Assigning such a nominal position

Even without a complete victory,
your achievements can't be ignored.

I'll take responsibility for the failure

to turn things around in Macau.

you've been pushing for the Imperial Army
to directly occupy Macau.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.200
But General Matsui
firmly opposes this strategy.

Despite your reluctance,

you'll have to find another way.

As for whether you
can make up for my disappointment

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.700
and completely resolve

General,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.470
I assure you

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.630
that I will spare no effort

to thoroughly eradicate

at all costs.

I asked you here this time

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.930
to repay a favor.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.360
A favor? What do you mean?

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.100
Last time I asked you to put on an act
in front of Wang Qizheng,

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.370
didn't I promise you

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.190
that I'd help you make a fortune?

00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.900
It was nothing.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.060

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.650
Is your President Saito from Lyun Coeng

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.320
going crazy lately,

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.030
buying up supplies everywhere?

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.680
He wants everything, no matter what it is.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.980
That's true. These Japanese

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.290
have gone desperate.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.510
I heard that in their country,

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.480
even cooking pots from ordinary homes

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.180
and nails from the roof beams
have all been collected.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.380
So now, no matter what can be purchased,

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.030
Saito is willing to pay top dollar.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.010
As long as one can get the goods,

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.720
the company offers
frighteningly high commissions.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.650
That's perfect.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.050
Recently, I've gathered

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.140
inventory from all merchants across Macau.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.810
There are some machines,
equipment, instruments,

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.010
and some small parts.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.460
But they're either too old

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:36.790
or incomplete sets.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.230
Nobody elsewhere would want them.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.020
But I wonder if President Saito

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.890
would mind.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.980
Mind? He wouldn't.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.570
Right now, for any metal products

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:45.740
that can be melted down and reused,

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.810
he'd be more than happy to take.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:47.610
Not to mention

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.340
there are so many usable items there.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.170
But one thing,

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.000
Xian,

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.900
do you really plan
to sell them to the Japanese?

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.190
Didn't you just say

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.360
Saito offers such high commissions?

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.000
Once this deal is done,

00:12:59.020 --> 00:12:59.650
the fortune I promised you

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.840
will be yours.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.100
But, Xian,

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.480
are you serious?

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.300
You still don't believe me?

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.110
However,

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.310
I have one condition.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:17.960
Chairman,

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.100
this is the list of supplies
I've recently acquired.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.240
Looks like quite a lot.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:27.590
Well done.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:28.870
Well done.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.530
You're too kind.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.190
Although the quantity is large this time,

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.720
the equipment and parts are incomplete,

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.610
and they cost a high price.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.840
Why worry about high prices?
Who cares if they're incomplete?

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.680
These supplies,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.750
for factories back home
suffering from bombings,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.760
are as precious as gold.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.550
Manager He,

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.810
you've done well.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.310
I'm giving you a bonus.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.260
One million.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.620
Thank you.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.290
However,

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.120
what's urgent now

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.230
is how to transport these supplies.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.740
As you know,

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.890
all the merchant ships in Macau

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:14.430
have been requisitioned by Command.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.660
We have no ocean transport capability now.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:26.830
Maybe there's a way
in Guangzhou or Hong Kong?

[Lyun Coeng Freight]

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.330
I just remembered.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.420
There's an opportunity.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.450
There are supplies
confiscated by Colonel Sawa

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.420
in the Steamship Sai On incident.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.790
Headquarters has specifically
arranged a ship

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.650
to transport them back home soon.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.060
Our Lyun Coeng shipment isn't that large.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.090
It would only take up a small corner
of the warehouse.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:45.140

They are both crucial supplies
desperately needed back home.

They're equally important.

I'll call the Southern China

Why are you apologizing?

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.740
I promised you before

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.280
that you could use the dividends
from Tai Fung Bank to buy land.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.280
These days,

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.530
But I still donated that money
to the guerrilla unit.

Tell me.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.410
Why do I want to buy properties?

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.530
So our family has assets and a foundation.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.320
Yes.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.100
A family must first
establish its foundation

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.359
to give its members peace of mind.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.940
But as the old saying goes,

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.880
wealth never survives 3 generations.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.599
And why is that?

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:17.440
Because even with great wealth,

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.550
you can't prevent

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.060
unfilial descendants.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.970
If descendants can

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.300
know what to prioritize,

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.560
understand the greater path,

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.550
and put the greater good

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.350
before personal interests

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.340
and country before family,

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:35.490
then why worry that this family

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.320
won't prosper

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.620

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.250
Tell me again.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.860
Did your father

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.610
do the right thing

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.440
to use the money that way?

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.000
Yes.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.520
Why is that right?

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.940
Because one should
prioritize the greater good

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.700
and put country before family.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.750

Well said.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.050
As long as you maintain this mindset
of prioritizing the greater good

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.170
and putting country before family,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.950

[Hang Taai Mercearia]

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.770
Kong it.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.710
I just got word

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.680
that those 2 Japanese ships,

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.020
boom, had been blown to bits!

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.840
Win via Draw after Kong with Four Kongs!

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.670
Isn't that a big hand?

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.950
It's beautiful.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.110
Yes.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.230
Yinwan.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:21.820
Yes?

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:23.370
When the war is over,

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.280
what are your plans for the future?

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.260
I've thought about it,

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.190
but I haven't decided yet.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.510
But I have.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.090
After all this is over,

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:36.650
I'll resign from the government

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.100
and sell Bachongtian Club.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:38.730
Why?

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.280
You've stayed at Bachongtian Club

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.610
because you have something you want to do.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.060
I've always known

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.420
that you long for a pure stage.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.690
Your violin

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.350
should be played for those

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.400
who truly appreciate music.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.500
I'm so tired after all these years.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.810
I want to leave all these disputes behind

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.280
and fulfill my dream

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.080
to establish

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.940
a genuine,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.910
pure orchestra

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.750
and return to the original purpose
of music.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:09.810
That's wonderful.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.830
Yes?

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.190
Will you do this with me?

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.780
In this war,

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.560
many children have lost their families
and homes.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.550
After the war ends,

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:30.900
I should return to the orphanage

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:31.870
to help those children

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.800
find hope in their lives again.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:36.910
Well then...

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.440
Then I'll go with you.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.530
Whatever you do,

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.060
I'll support you.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:51.950
Dr. Lok Pak.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.190
Actually, I think

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.660
you should do

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.230
what you truly want to do.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.120

[Chengxin Company Order]

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.360
Getting so much cargo this time.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.200
When I first got the order,

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.430
I didn't expect the quantity
to be so large.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.100
Mr. He and Mr. Ke's appetite

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.780
is getting bigger and bigger.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.330
It's not about my appetite.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.040
The war situation is developing rapidly,

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.640
and domestic demand is high.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.680
Ever since the bombers
from Zhijiang Airport

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.890
could fly directly
to the Japanese homeland

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.130
and drop bombs on their Imperial Palace,

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.990
the Japanese have been panicked.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.250
Yang Chang's intelligence station

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.040
has also received notice from above.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.000
They say the Japanese

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.830
are desperately moving troops,

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.580
preparing for a large-scale attack
on Zhijiang.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.840
Hundreds of thousands of national troops
are preparing to meet them head-on.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.240
The battle line is already far from
the Yunnan-Guizhou rear.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.410
Once the battle begins,

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.650
relying on the Burma Road and the Hump

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.800
for limited supplies won't be enough.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.180
So,

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.230
the supplies coming through Macau
this time

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:23.690
are more than ever before.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:24.510
That's right.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.820
And in North and Central China,

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.370
taking advantage
of the enemy's vulnerable rear,

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:28.820
the Eighth Route Army
and the New Fourth Army

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.970
are also about to launch
a full counteroffensive.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.180
The supply gap is significant,

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.780
so we've asked Mr. Rodrigues

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.030
to help with the procurement.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.010
Excellent.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.900
The day we have long awaited—

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.430
the counteroffensive—has finally arrived.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.440
I think the goods
will arrive in a day or two.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.000
You'll need to prepare more manpower;

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.600
otherwise,

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.810
I won't be able to unload everything.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.330
Luo, don't worry.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:52.920
However many people you need,

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.640
I'll send them to you.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.360
Good.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:56.140
Also,

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.160
the Japanese anti-smuggling rights
in Macau

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.290
have been canceled,

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.690
but this shipment is extremely important.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:02.900
Better safe than sorry.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.020
So when the time comes,

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.220
we'll all keep watch at the pier.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:05.650
Yeah.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.360
Sure.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.640
I'll have Gonçalves
send more Portuguese police

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.190
and find a reason to secure the pier

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.320
to ensure the safety of this shipment.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.610
This is also it.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.980
Mr. Fukue!

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.600
Look at these.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.010
I've gathered all the investigation
and surveillance information

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.320
about anti-Japanese forces in Macau

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:54.220
from the past 3 years!

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.340
I plan to compile

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:58.970
a detailed analysis report,

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.810
along with new recommendations
for Macau operations,

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.470
to submit to Command as soon as possible.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.050
New recommendations for Macau operations?

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.380
What recommendations?

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.310
Of course, the armed occupation of Macau.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.140
What else could it be?

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:18.640
Mr. Fukue.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.690
You know everything that's happened
these past 3 years.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:24.800
The entire Macau

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.200
has been completely controlled by He Xian

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.140
and anti-Japanese elements.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.300
The Anglo-American forces
have established contact with them,

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.820
and the Portuguese Macau government
has joined their camp.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.170
If the Imperial Army deploys immediately
to occupy Macau,

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:46.420
the Macau issue
can be completely resolved!

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.490
Then why did you ask me to come?

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:55.500
I want you to jointly submit
this proposal with me.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.210
General Matsui is very displeased with me

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.960
and doesn't agree with
the military occupation strategy.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:07.180
I alone can't convince Command.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:16.280
Why?

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.740
You don't want to co-sign?

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.760
Well then,

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.840
you can take the lead in submitting it,

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.740
and I'll co-sign. That works too.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.180
It seems I do need to submit

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.500
a formal written proposal to Command.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.360
That's more like it.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.630
I'll draft the report immediately.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.810
You'll just need to sign it.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.430
I'm submitting it myself,

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.980
not jointly with you.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.140
Not jointly with me?

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.320
Then what do you

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.160
plan to recommend?

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.540
I recommend that Command

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.390
abolish the Sawa Agency.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:15.330
What are you thinking?

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.200
Have you lost your mind?

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.390
I'm not crazy!

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:23.220
You are!

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.770
Your sheer obstinacy

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.760
has led to

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:34.200
the irreversible situation in Macau.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.240
I did it all for the Empire,

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.360
for the Sacred War,

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.500
and for the Emperor!

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.610
No!

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:47.550
You simply

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:51.260
can't accept defeat!

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.460
Ever since you were repeatedly
defeated by those Chinese merchants,

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.660
especially by He Xian,

00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:58.700
Sawa,

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.220
you've gone mad!

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.790
You're escalating the situation.

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.220
Even when the Imperial Army

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.090
is in such an unfavorable position,

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.290
you still want to use them
to occupy Macau!

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:28.610
Your insane ideas

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.750
have seriously jeopardized
the Empire's Sacred War.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.570
As the Consul in Macau,

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:41.420
I must take responsibility
for the Empire's interests.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:42.750
Therefore,

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.750
I will submit a report to Command,

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.750
detailing all your actions
over the past 3 years

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.330
with comprehensive documentation.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.750
I believe that once Command
receives my report,

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.070
they'll take appropriate action
against Sawa Agency.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.490
Great. The goods have finally arrived.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.640
Chief.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.000
Chief.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.490
Chief.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:46.560
Are you alright?

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.510
Chief,

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.690
Captain Huang has important information
to report.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:00.030
Chief,

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.530
we just discovered something important.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:03.630
At the inner harbor pier,

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:04.800
Rodrigues' company

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.080
has 2 large cargo ships that have docked.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.620
Since they started unloading,

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.690
the Portuguese police have completely
sealed off the entire port.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.020
Nobody is allowed near.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.030
But the people unloading

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.640
seem to all be
from the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.630
Our people simply can't get close.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.460
Also,

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.900
He Xian and his people were there too.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.950
They kept watch for 2 whole days

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.230
while they were unloading the cargo.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.700
They didn't leave

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.400
until all the goods were placed

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.890
in Rodrigues' warehouse.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:34.870
Chief,

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.280
according to Captain Huang's report,

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.650
the underground anti-Japanese forces
in Macau

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.250
are organizing the transport
of new supplies,

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.100
and the quantity is unprecedented.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.000
What do you think we should do?

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.110
Major Yamaguchi,

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:01.800
well, this...

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.000
Keep monitoring the situation first.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.900
I'll report to Chief later.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:09.660
Yes.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.920
Wait.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.000
Chief.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:30.440
There's a mission

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.880
I need you to arrange right away.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.030
What is it? Please give me your orders.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.700
Chief,

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.310
are you sure about this?

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.020
Was I

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:18.240
not clear enough?

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:22.950
Yes.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:24.950
In this matter,

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:30.210
I'll follow your instructions.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.070
I'll do my best.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.420
Consul,

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.710
the early morning ship to Guangzhou

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.400
will depart in one hour.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.460
The car is ready.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.900
This is a top-secret report for Command.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:57.690
Asahina,

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.280
you're responsible for safekeeping it.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:00.910
Yes.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:03.010
Let's go.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:40.520
Consul!

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:09.060
[Operating Room]

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:17.880
Stand guard here

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.680
and don't move an inch.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.760
I'll go report to Chief.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:23.920
Yes.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.300
Hello?

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:29.790
Dr. Ke.

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:32.690
What?

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.150
Yasumitsu Fukae has been assassinated?

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.390
This will be like an earthquake for Macau.

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:38.480
Contact everyone immediately

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.550
to prepare for contingencies.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:41.320
Especially regarding
the Portuguese Macau government,

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.530
you must stay informed of the situation

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:43.930
and try to keep them calm.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.870
Alright, I understand.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:54.070
Wang Qiuzai and Fearless Biao

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.880
have been hidden
in my underground smoking room.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.780
That place is very secluded.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.650
Ordinary people would never find it.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:00.420
However...

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.340
However what?

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:06.780
Fearless Biao,

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.540
when he grabbed the briefcase,

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:11.440
seems to have been spotted
by Fukue's secretary.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:12.910
Just...

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.980
Just a glimpse.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.470
It shouldn't be a problem.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.650
Hello?

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:27.940
I got it.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.580
Keep watching closely.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.040
Report immediately if anything happens.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.300
Bring Fearless Biao back.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:48.190
Now?

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.860
Yamaguchi just reported

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.520
that Asahina has been taken to surgery.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.020
The hospital says
his injuries are very serious.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.790
There's little hope for his recovery.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.050
Wang Qiuzai is responsible
for reconnaissance.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:06.300
He can stay hidden.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.730
But Fearless Biao

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.280
is the action team leader
of your Special Operations Team.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.530
He's always at the forefront
of everything.

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:16.160
At a time like this, he can't be hiding.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:20.170
Otherwise, people might become
suspicious of him.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:21.350
Yes,

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:23.460
I'll take care of it right away.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:38.330
Hello?

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.730
Is it General Matsui?

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:42.560
This is Sawa Eisaku.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.550
I have terrible news.

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.000
Consul Fukue...

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.820
Consul Fukue...

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.220
Just now,

00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.450
he was killed!

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:02.830
I'm sorry!

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.180
I'm sorry!

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:09.470
Yes!

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:10.700
Yes.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.730
Yes.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:49.800
♪ City of joy ♪

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.400
♪ City of love ♪

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:57.670
♪ Paradise of dreams ♪

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:01.420
♪ Flourishing Tokyo ♪

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.120
This

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.170
is the newly-received ultimatum

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:11.380
from the Empire of Japan
to the Portuguese Government

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.840
and the Macau government.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.240
It states that the assassination
of Yasumitsu Fukae

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:19.520
is the greatest provocation
against the Empire of Japan.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:22.150
The Macau government bears

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:23.980
undeniable responsibility for this.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.850
Therefore,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.800
the Japanese
Southern China Expeditionary Army

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.210
has imposed a punitive blockade on Macau

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:32.960
and reserves the right
to take further military action

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:35.000
until the facts of this case are clarified

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.840
and the perpetrator is properly punished.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:39.630
The Japanese side has appointed

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:43.390
Keiichi Imai,
Deputy Consul General of Guangdong,

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.010
to urgently take over
as the new consul in Macau

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:46.940
and proceed to Macau,

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.630
demanding that upon Consul Imai's arrival,

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.780
he takes over all investigative authority
for this case.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.690
The Macau government and police
must fully cooperate

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:57.090
without any interference or obstruction.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.600
Allowing the Japanese
to conduct investigations in Macau?

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.770
This is an outright usurpation
of our judicial sovereignty!

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:06.230
Exactly. This is absolutely unacceptable.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.870
How can we possibly let
the Japanese handle the investigations?

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.730
The government should immediately
protest to Japan

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:12.950
and demand they respect international law!

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:13.800
Everyone!

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.090
Look carefully.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.230
This is Japan's ultimatum

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.030
with no room for negotiation.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.320
The Japanese are fully prepared

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.650
to deploy troops to Macau at any moment.

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:26.760
Accept it, or declare war.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.860
No other options!

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.230
The immediate issue

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:38.970
is that a foreign consul
has died in Macau.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:40.240
No matter what,

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.510
we do bear some responsibility.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:44.960
The Japanese don't trust
the Macau government,

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.430
and we have no choice
but to accept it now.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:52.670
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:54.260
there's big trouble with the Fukue case.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.590
What has happened?

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.270
The police have just found

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.730
the abandoned vehicle
involved in the murder on the shore.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.360
Investigation shows
it belongs to Rodrigues' company.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.690
My company's car?

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:04.960
Yes. Along with the car,

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.280
your secretary Santos' body
was also found.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.390
One of the murder weapons
from the Fukue case was in his hand.

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:11.520
Damn it.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.200
This is a frame-up.

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.790
This is clearly a setup!

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:18.360
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.690
when will the new Japanese Consul arrive?

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.670
Keiichi Imai has left Guangzhou

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.800
and will arrive in Macau at 10 tonight.

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:31.340
So in 5 more hours,

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:32.510
the Japanese will take over

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:33.570
the investigation of the Fukue case?

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.050
Yes.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.000
I guess their first search target

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.780
will definitely be my company
and warehouse.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.670
So we must act before then

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.210
and quickly move these supplies

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:42.000
into hiding.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:46.560
But my fleet has just arrived at the port.

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.270
Now the entire Macau

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.800
has been completely blockaded

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.050
by the Japanese.

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:53.300
The fleet can't leave at all now.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.050
Besides,
the quantity of goods is so large.

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:57.870
Just unloading them

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.450
took 2 whole days.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.760
In such a short time,

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:04.900
how can we possibly transport everything?
