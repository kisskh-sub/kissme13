is approaching once again.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.540
In a city like Nanjing,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.100
where universities are clustered,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.700
frequent farewells

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.840
have become routine.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.560
Yet the pressure of employment

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.600
often outweighs the sadness of parting.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:18.800
This year,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.920
the number of college graduates
in Jiangsu Province

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.740
has surpassed 2011,

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.160
setting a new record.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.200
In April,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.380
Nanjing will host

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.100
several large-scale job fairs.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:31.840
Watch where you're going.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.060
Quick, tell everyone

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.960
my internship's over,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.280
and I'm back in Nanjing.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.460
[Xigua]
Roll out the red carpet at the gate!

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.760
[Fen]

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.520
I heard someone needs a welcome party

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.480
just for coming back.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.600
Who is it?

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.680
So full of herself.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.400
Don't know her.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.460
[Xigua]
Then forget it.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.060
I've got a chicken in one hand

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.420
and a duck in the other.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.840
My arms are killing me.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.120
I should just dump them in the car.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.980
[Fen]

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.120
Right on the way.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.740
So, tell us.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.540
How do you want us lined up?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.180
[Boss]
My dear Xigua,

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.500
hearing you got back a day earlier,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.180
I'm over the moon
and running over to see you!

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.460
[Feng]
If you're bringing

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.660
chicken, duck, and fish,

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.100
you could've just kept it between us.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.440
Why make me tell everyone?

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.580
So inconsiderate.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.440
[Siliang]
Getting off at the north gate, right?

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:38.460
Don't go away.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.520
There's a surprise.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.440
A surprise?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.640
[Nanjing Jiangning University]
[Key Cultural Relics Protection Unit]

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:50.580
Thanks.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:51.960
Take care.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.240
[Feng]
I smelled it way over there.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.400
This whole car is pumping

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.800
braised-chicken air.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.140
Knew it!

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.260
Xigua.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.940
The chicken

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:05.640
is pretty huge.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.760
[Boss]
How do you even know

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.860
that it is braised chicken in it?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.080
[Fen]
I told you I can smell it.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.360
Braised chicken, beer-braised duck.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.480
You guys really went all out.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.020
Just one chicken and one duck,

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.840
no need for the whole dorm to show up.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.500
[Siliang]
We had a surprise for you, remember?

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.640
Why aren't they here yet?

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.200
Here they come.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.720
Finally.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.400
Took you long enough.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:41.980
Sorry,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:42.960
we're late.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.780
Yeah, got it.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.020
You two

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.340
came together?

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.500
We just ran into each other on the way.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.060
[Ye Rong]

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.020
Xiguang,

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.260
welcome back.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.680

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.220
What's going on here?

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.320
I only brought a chicken and a duck.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.140
Will that be enough?

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.340
Did you really think

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:05.920
we came

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.880
just for your braised chicken?

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.520
We're having dinner at Hesheng tonight.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.000
So can I count this

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.820
as a special contribution

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.620
and skip my share?

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.640
Please

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.820
don't embarrass us.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.380
Zhuang Xu is treating us.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.280
Really?

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:21.620
Yeah.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.040
What's with that tone?

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.980
I was just a bit surprised.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.400
He got an offer

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.920
from Shanghai Huaya Bank,

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.040
with a monthly salary over 10000.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.100
So he's treating everyone to dinner

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:34.980
to celebrate.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.820

Congratulations, Zhuang Xu.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.300
Well,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.020
when we hit Shanghai for some fun,

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:47.860
we'll be relying on you.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.200
Aren't you supposed to be back
till tomorrow?

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:54.900
Zhuang Xu,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.980
are you treating us or not?

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:56.940
I'm starving.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.860
stir-fried beef with cumin.

How did Zhuang Xu

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.120
know

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.520
I wasn't coming back until tomorrow?

as neighbors.

who mentioned it.

And this dish, please.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.680
That's enough.

and what he's treating is on him.

Nothing gets left out.

Boiled fish with pickled mustard greens.

Okay.

What kind would you like?

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.200
We've got

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.020
orange juice

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.260
and watermelon juice.

from our Business School

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.400
to land a five‑figure monthly salary.

If the money's rolling in,

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.840
don't forget your mates.

how much I'll miss campus life.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:34.940
No more

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.360
checking in on the track

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.040
or lining up at the cafeteria.

Once you all start working

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.620
and raking it in,

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.020
don't forget to spot me dinner

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:58.760
now and then.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.820
All you ever think about is food.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.100
Rong,

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.380
you've got offers

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.420
from both Nanjing and Shanghai, right?

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.400
But you're definitely choosing Shanghai,

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.060
aren't you?

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.520
Shanghai's got plenty of opportunities

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.580
and lots of room to grow.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.080
I'd planned on choosing Shanghai
all along.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:13.760
It's just

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.880
the job offers

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.440
I've got right now

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.480
aren't really satisfying.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.920
Next week there's a big job fair

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.980
at the International Exhibition Center.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.040
Are you guys going?

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.480
I heard a lot of companies from Shanghai

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.060
will be there.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.220
I'm definitely going.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.180
Me, too.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.480
What about you, Xigua?

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.420
Xiguang's family is so well-off.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.680
Getting into a company in Shanghai

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.700
should be a breeze, right?

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.000
Not at all.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.400
I'm heading back to Wuxi.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.280
Wuxi?

he was a solid guy.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.120
deliberately try to piss Rong off?

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:09.760

My phone's gone.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.120
Did Rong get a new phone?

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.540
Seems her family gave her an earful.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.940
Come on,

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.620
it's not like she meant to lose it.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.340
It's been missing for days.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.000
What if it messes up her interview?

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.720
Don't worry.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.860

Boss.

When will you ever remember

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:01.820
to take your phone to bed?

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.680
It's a call from Shanghai.

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.120
Thanks. Boss.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.320
Hello?

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:15.700
Okay.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.280
Just a moment.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.740
The interview time.

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.240
The location.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.320
Thanks.

Xigua.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.000
Did you get the interview notice?

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.640
Which company is it?

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.040
Shengyuan.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.400
Wow, impressive. It's a big company.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.860
Isn't this the one

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.900
Zhuang Xu helped you apply to?

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.000
Rong, did you send in your résumé too?

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.720
Big companies get flooded
with applications,

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.140
so they run interviews in batches.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.740
Maybe since Xiguang's résumé

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:56.680
was the last in,

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.420
landed on the top of the pile

00:41:58.520 --> 00:41:59.520
and got picked first.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:00.900
If you ask me,

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.040
Zhuang Xu deserves some credit too.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.780
Rong, don't worry.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.280
The notice will come any minute.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.540
Yes.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.620
That's the point.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:08.860
Rong, you've got more certificates

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.060
than Xigua by far.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.700
You'll definitely get an interview too.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.060
You...

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.600
Skipping the nine-to-five

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.420
and staying in school a few more years
was the right call.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.100
Your EQ is beyond saving.

what you said is true,

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.680
it seriously pissed me off.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.940
So you'll have to make it up to me

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.360
and help me get ready for the interview.
