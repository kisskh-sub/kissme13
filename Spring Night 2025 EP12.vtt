(Virtue's Fragrance Lasts)

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.560
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:18.280
(Imperial Edict)

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.000
Ancestors above,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.600
I, Qiu Xuanling,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.800
have not brought shame
upon our forebears.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.080
Now,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.120
His Majesty has decreed

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.360
that I

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.520
serve as regent with full authority.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.920
Father,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.080
it seems

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.240
the Crown Prince's corpse

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.640
has devastated His Majesty.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.200
Of course.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.320
Seeing

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.520
the Crown Prince's disfigured body

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.880
left him utterly heartbroken.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.600
He fell gravely ill.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.800
Now,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.520
the entire court

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.680
is in my grasp.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.800
Once you bear the royal heir,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.280
no one

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.080
will be able to stop

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.640
our cause.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.280
Congratulations, Father.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.160
Therefore,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.400
remember this.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.600
Protect the child
in your womb at all costs.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.400
No mistakes allowed.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.160
Understood.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.600
I have never

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.480
pressed you about whom that man is.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.640
I wished to spare you the shame.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.400
But given the situation,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.040
that man you disgraced yourself with

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.000
cannot remain alive.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.600
I understand.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.200
If you show any mercy...

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.240
Rest assured, Father.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.640
I will personally deliver

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.480
his head to you.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.400
Remember your promise to me.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.880
You're back.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.840
You've left for so long.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280
Did you miss me?

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.320
Come on.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.400
Come here.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.880
Didn't you say

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.400
you liked street food?

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.200
I had someone get this for you.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.720
Do you like it?

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.440
What business do you
have with me, my lady?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.520
What's wrong with you?

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.280
What?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.240
Securing an official post

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.240
and entering the court,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.240
have you forgotten who your master is?

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.600
Or perhaps,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.800
something happened

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.400
in Penglai Village?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.680
I would never keep anything from you.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.200
Good.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.880
If that's all,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.440
I'll report
to the Personnel Evaluation Bureau.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.800
I'm done with you now.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.800
That official robe of yours
is such a turn-off.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.240
Get out.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.200
Someone!

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.800
Investigate

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.880
what really happened

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.240
in Penglai Village.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.000
Yes.

00:06:27.616 --> 00:06:28.823
Why'd I listen to you?

00:06:29.337 --> 00:06:30.016
Let's go.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.440
Could it be

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.000
the Shen family's jade pendant?

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.800
Is it possible someone
from the Shen family survived?

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.040
Go to Penglai Village.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.920
Investigate thoroughly

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.720
whether any remnant
of the Shen family is still live.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.920
Yes.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.720
You've been studying all day.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.800
You must be exhausted.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.640
No.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.640
Still angry?

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.800
No.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.800
I won't live on handouts.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.320
Nonsense!

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.600
I made this for my husband.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.040
How can that be handouts?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.800
Husband...

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.800
Who knows what you're thinking?

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.560
Who was that man?

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.000
You still refuse to tell me.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.400
He is my brother.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.200
My blood brother.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.920
Brother?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.520
The Shen family?

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.680
So that's how it is.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.880
I'm sorry.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.600
It was me overthinking things.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.200
I have kept pressing you.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.200
I apologize.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.520
It's fine.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.880
My brother told me

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.200
I can't tell anyone

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.840
about his affairs.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.800
But you're my husband.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.000
I don't want to keep secrets
from you anymore.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.280
Silly girl.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.400
Alright.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.640
Since that's the case,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.680
then I

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.840
can't hide anything from you either.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.000
Hide something?

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.200
Ye Wuming,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.480
what's going on with you?

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.840
You still have secrets?

00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.920
Tell me.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.920
Sit down and you'll find out.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.360
Don't try to dodge this.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.200
Hurry up and tell me!

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.880
I lost my memory.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.600
I don't know.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.720
How can you do this?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.680
Wuming,

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.360
I...

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.400
I'll go first...

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520
It's all your fault!

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.200
How is that my fault?

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.000
Wuming,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.120
go home.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
This is the academy.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.800
Doing this here
changes the nature of this.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.240
Why did you answer him?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.096
'Why did you answer him?'

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.840
Who would've thought

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.400
the daughter of the disgraced official
Shen Jinyuan

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.800
is actually alive,

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.920
and is hidden

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.360
by the servant Mai Tianlin

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.480
in Penglai Village,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.200
disguised as a common girl.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.400
Interesting.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.320
Feng,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.400
didn't I tell you before?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.480
When coming to see me,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.040
you don't need to wear court robes.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.600
Everything is at your discretion.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.720
Now, most of the imperial court

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.640
is under my control.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.080
Since you work
at Personnel Evaluation Bureau,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.520
there are certain matters

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.000
you should help me with.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:37.920
Yes,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.680
Godfather.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.080
Do you know of Shen Jinyuan?

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.280
No, I don't.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.600
You certainly wouldn't know.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.840
He was an old friend of mine.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.400
15 years ago, he was convicted.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.120
His entire family was executed.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.400
But who would've imagined

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.600
that his daughter is still alive.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.000
She's hidden right in Penglai Village.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.000
The Crown Prince's body

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.240
was also discovered in Penglai Village.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.440
Isn't that a coincidence?

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.640
So you mean...

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.000
