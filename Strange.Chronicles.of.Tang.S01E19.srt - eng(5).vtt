00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.550
was around midnight last night.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.480
As to what weapon caused

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.840
the wound on her head

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.230
is still undetermined.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.400
Lu Lingfeng.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.080
Take a look at this wound.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.480
Could the weapon possibly be

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.750
a polo mallet?

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.680
The size does match.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.910
But polo mallets are all made of wood.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.680
No matter how strong the attacker was,

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.610
they couldn't possibly cause

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.610
a wound like this.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.120
So aren't there any polo mallets

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.200
made of other materials?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.960
Like gold, silver, copper, or iron?

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.560
There are.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.510
But they're extremely rare.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.860
Those used in polo matches are all wooden.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.870
Those of other materials...

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.390
are used for ceremonial occasions.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.790
Ceremonial occasions...

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.810
You once said there would be more deaths.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.460
Your intuition was right.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.630
Your instinct told you

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.230
Ma Meng wasn't the murderer,

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.670
and you were right about that, too.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.740
Since yesterday afternoon,

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.790
I had Yingtao

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.910
watch Ma Meng secretly continuously

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.530
for 12 hours.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.840
He had no opportunity to commit the crime.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.220
Also, Zhu Ling and Zheng Zhong

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.510
both served as officials
in the Eastern Palace

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.310
and followed Crown Prince Hong.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.210
These are all matters

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.200
from 40 years ago.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.790
Your investigation is remarkably thorough—

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.750
no easy feat.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.600
I didn't intentionally investigate this.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.910
It was Wei Yan who told me

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.150
he was once colleagues with these two.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.670
[Wei's Residence]

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.180
Wei Yan.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.960
You've practiced martial arts
since childhood

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.720
and entered service as a jinshi scholar.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.750
In the future,
do you wish to serve in court

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.150
or lead troops in battle?

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.960
Whether it's staying in the capital
to protect Your Highness

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.200
or leading troops at the frontier

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.150
to defend the Tang Empire—

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.810
I will follow whatever
Your Highness commands.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:14.170
You are indeed loyal.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.790
[Crown Prince, Li Hong]

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.250
After I ascend the throne,

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.510
you must be
even more diligent and ambitious.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.640
Then you will surely

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.240
become a great general or minister.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.130
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.210
Who's there?

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.940
Sheriff Wei.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.880
It's you.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.460
What brings you here so late?

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.360
Sheriff Wei,

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.950
carrying a sword so late at night—

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.060
have you noticed something unusual?

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.790
Unusual?

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.250
I, Wei, fear neither heaven nor earth,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.530
much less any demons or monsters.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.410
Lu Lingfeng,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.200
I know your martial skills
are exceptional.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.480
Since you came from the rooftop,

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.270
why bother knocking?

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.060
Rooftop?

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.330
Who's there?

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:55.940
Sheriff Su,

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.940
it's probably just a petty thief.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.250
Why should I fear?

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.540
Someone came from the roof...

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.220
Wait!

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.750
Please put the teacup back where it was.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:28.160
Sheriff Wei.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.970
If I'm not mistaken,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.300
this tea has been poisoned.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.630
What?

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.720
Look.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.350
The poison dripped from the ceiling

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.520
and fell right into this cup of tea.
