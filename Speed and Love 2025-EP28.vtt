Something's wrong with you.

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.600
What's wrong?

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.479
You're not planning...

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.280
to marry Mu, are you?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.370
How did you know?

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.020
Everything you bought is for her.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.570
Every single thing.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.760

Tell me.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.600
Eggs.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.720

Ready.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.790
Action!

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.480
Can you handle it?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.920
Beating you is not a problem.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.649
I'm only using 70% of my skills.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.500
I'll race with just one arm.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.440
You're driving really well.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.550
So about you coming back to drive for me,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.120
have you thought it over?

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.450
Just drive carefully.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.500
You're my advisor.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.210
But I'd rather

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.640
you come back to drive.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.130
The racing team has been waiting for you.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.159
Mu,

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.150
get me a glass of water, okay?

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.310
You know...

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.670
why I don't drive.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.650
Let's not talk about this for now.

You're a man in love now.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.920
That kind of girl is truly rare.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.650
And you're not young anymore.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.520
It's normal to want stability.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.980
But you should also consider what I said.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.810
She's worth it.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.230

What's wrong?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.620
I have a meeting today.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.820

There's no time. I have to go.

I packed it. Eat on the way.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.260
Thank you. You're so thoughtful.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.230
Be careful.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.480
I'm off.

Do you smell it?

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:50.600
Yes.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:51.910
What's that smell?

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.190
I don't know.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:54.470
Wake up.

-Sir!
-The bus is smoking!

Sir, the bus is smoking!

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.000
No way.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.950

-Stop the bus!
-The bus is smoking!

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.440
Okay, okay. I'm stopping right away.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:32.700

Where are you?

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.350
You didn't get on the bus?

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.920
I'm at the convenience store downstairs.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.070
Can you bring me the documents

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.040
on the table?

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.000
Zhao,

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.400
did you hear me?

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.310
Wait for me.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.150
I'm glad that you're okay.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:38.690
Did you...

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.210
drive here yourself?

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.760
You can drive again?

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.240
Slow down.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.670
Ease off the pedal suddenly.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.670
Slow down.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.160
Be careful. Slow down. Slow down.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.470
Be careful.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.190
Very good. Slow down.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.520
Slow down.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.970
All these years,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.160
I thought silence and absence

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.470
were protection and sacrifice.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.760
But year after year,

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:06.710
day after day,

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.670
in every day of my absence,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.490
you stubbornly waited.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:13.710
Mu.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.120
Thank you for staying with me all along,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.780
helping me understand

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.480
that true love
isn't self-righteous sacrifice,

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.950
but 2 hearts,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.320
defying wind and rain together,
resisting a broken life.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.160
I understand now.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.520
True courage

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.970
isn't charging into battle alone.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.030
It's allowing oneself

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.240
to become a wound that's tenderly guarded.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.180
Try this.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.400
It's delicious.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.650
Is there any difference...

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.880
from what he made?

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.160
At that time,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.980
I was still abroad.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.040
The rehabilitation was going well.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.050
I no longer needed a wheelchair

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.450
and could manage to walk.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.070
Lin Sui kept asking me

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.970
to be his driver in the future.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.000
I understood what he meant.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.260
He was encouraging me in that way.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.310
Given my physical condition at the time,

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.840
how could I possibly drive?

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.260
And I didn't know
what I could do in the future.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.910
I wondered what you

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.790
would want me to do.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.990
You'd probably want me to study.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.920
When I got tired from studying,

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.240
I would read the letters you wrote to me.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.120
Those letters

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.790
gave me faith.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.890
Kid, come and eat!

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.000
Noodles are here.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:36.820
Chopsticks.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:40.950
Wait.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.580
Chopped scallions

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.830
are the soul of this bowl of noodles.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.280
How's your studying going?

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.730
Not bad.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.360
Don't overwork yourself.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.310
Your body needs more rest now.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.730
Have you been in touch with Mu lately?

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.370
When Mu was little,

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.830
she loved it most
when I cooked noodles for her.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.240
When you get the chance in the future,

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.240
help me cook a bowl of noodles for Mu.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.000
I hope

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.160
she can remember the taste
of this bowl of noodles.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:01.640
Got it.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:08.660
I've quit drinking.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.560
I've quit drinking.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:13.890
Why?

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.510
I can't handle it anymore.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.119
I'm tired.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.300
I need to take good care
of your sister, Jin Xin.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.030
I can't

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.070
make the same mistake again.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.310
Eat.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.880
How does it taste?

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.610
Pretty good.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.800
Good. Eat more.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.760
Maybe it's because he's old.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.320
He's a bit...

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.510
sentimental now.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.510
He's realized that he wasn't there for you

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.340
during some important moments
in your life.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:23.950
And he regrets it.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.080
He wants to make it up to you,

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.280
even if it's just cooking you a good meal

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.300
or a bowl of Yangchun noodles.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.030
He wants you to know

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.890
that his love for you...

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.320
isn't fake.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.120
He just lost himself before.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.270
Actually,

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.880
he could have told me all this
over the phone.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.280
I understand him on this.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.190
Men sometimes

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.000
aren't very good at saying mushy things...

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.190
face to face.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.420
I stopped resenting him long ago.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.270
I only remember...

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.130
that he loved racing.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.880
When I was little,

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.670
he always took me out to play with cars
behind Mom's back.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.640
Without cars,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.690
it was like he lost his soul.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.120
I won't be like that.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.670
Racing...

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.400
isn't my dream.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.560

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.020
I told you

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.260
to send me a message,

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.360
so I could ask Chris
to pick you up at the airport.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.670
No need to trouble him. We took a taxi.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:38.770
Mom,

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.510
Zhao is back too.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:51.470

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:52.640

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.160
Here, Mu,

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:19.250
have some shrimps.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.080
Mu, you know what?

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.880
Chris is worried and curious

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.160
about your work.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.400
Worried?

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.050
Worried about what?

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.880
In your last call,

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.880
you said the sun was going to explode

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.280
and we'd all turn to dust.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.360
He was so scared
that he couldn't sleep well for a week.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.320
Right?

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.670
That was just an astrophysics documentary.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.640
Before that, there is another line:

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.570
"It will take about 6 billion years

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.440
before the sun might explode."

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.120
The life cycle of celestial bodies

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.180
is closely related to life and death.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:50.430
Think about it.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.920
If there's an atom in your body

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.230
that was once born, grew, and decayed

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:57.670
in the distant cosmos,

00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:59.720
how romantic would that be?

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.710
It does sound romantic.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.800
But why did I find it terrifying
last time?

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.950
It's not terrifying.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:08.750
It's that you're a scaredy-cat.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.190
If Earth is going to explode,

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:11.850
shouldn't we be a bit nervous?

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.640
Honey,

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.050
I think you've always been very calm.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.400
You must have known
it'll take 6 billion years, right?

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:19.400
Yes, yes.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.270
After Mu mentioned it last time,

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.350
I immediately watched that documentary.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.750
I even watched it 3 times.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.720
Actually,
you were just worrying unnecessarily.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:28.950
Stupid.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.320
What? Annoying?

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.360
Well, Honey,

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.560
did I upset you again?

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:40.400
Zhao,

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.770
you watched that documentary too.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.030
Cosmic Wonders.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.600
There's a red nebula in it.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.400
The visuals are very beautiful.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.710
Such a big dumpling—

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.240
I bet it can shut your mouth.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.180
You've all watched it?

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.320
So I've been alone?

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.360
You mean "isolated", right?

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.270
Not "alone".

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:08.210
Fine.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.160
Mu,

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:16.930
how's your current place?

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.890
I terminated the lease.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:26.920
What?

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.820
You terminated the lease?

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.840
Where do you live now?

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.400
Mu is staying at my place now.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.430
I don't think it'll take

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.880
6 billion years for Earth to explode.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.470
Mu, don't you think so?

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:19.510
Also,

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.310
next time you watch a movie,

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.590
take me with you, okay?

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.890
Jin Zhao,
this is your first time in Canada,

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:49.290
right?

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.160
Yes, Uncle.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.600
Since you're here, make yourself at home.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:54.400
Relax.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.880
In the morning, you can get up early.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.190
The air is especially fresh.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:59.320
You might see some small animals,

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.230
like beavers and red foxes.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:03.470
-They are not afraid of humans.
-Chris.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.920
I told you to help me tidy the guest room.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.950
Is it ready?

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:10.470
It's ready.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.190
Okay.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:01.920
Jin Zhao,

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:03.990
you're still up?

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.489
I don't have any elders around to ask,

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:30.880
so I asked my colleagues
about the customs...

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.280
for proposing marriage.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.489
I'm not sure if I've missed anything
or done anything improperly.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.840
I'm not someone

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.970
who can fully meet your expectations,

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.040
but Mu has always been

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.240
the person I cherish most,

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.790
whether as a younger sister in the past

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.320
or as a beloved partner from now on.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.360
I came this time

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.150
to tell you in person...

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.110
that from now on,

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.300
no matter what circumstances I face,

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:57.130
I will take good care of Mu

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.170
and never let her suffer.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:09.130
Please...

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.420
entrust her to me.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.110
Mom.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.800
You two had a long journey today.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:58.770
Rest early.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.510
Jin Zhao,

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.320
some things can't be rushed.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.380
Take it slow.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.880
And give her some time.
