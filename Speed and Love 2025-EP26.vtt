This is Mu's boyfriend.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.930
-So handsome!
-You should treat us to this meal.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:20.970
You've taken away the goddess

they weren't reconciled yet.

about their wedding.

So,

I'll try to make it happen soon.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.170

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.350
You actually paid for everything.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.700
It's my pleasure.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.409
Thank you so much for the meal.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.000
We’re leaving.
Thank you so much.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.610
Bye.
Bye.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.200
-Take care on your way.
-Bye-bye.

-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.600
The rain is so heavy.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.330
We can't drive 'cause we drank.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.360
What should we do?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.660
It's not far. Let's walk back.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.800
But we don't have umbrellas.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.760
I can't see the road like this.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.650
I'm here. Stay close.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.610
Don't get wet.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.270
You're not abducting me, are you?

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:34.500
Who knows?

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.480
Look at you.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:58.900
You're soaking wet.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.360
Go take a shower quickly.
Don't catch a cold.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.130
Okay. Wait for me in the living room.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.810
You saw it?

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.330
How long did it take
for you to put it together?

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.680
Adding up both times,

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.350
quite a while.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.720
Two times?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.080
When it was being transported here,

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.370
it fell apart once.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.080
When I moved it here and reassembled it,

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.810
I lost the instruction manual.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.410
The second time was quite difficult.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.590
What about the other time?

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.170
The first time...

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.500
That was when you had just gone to Canada.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.590
I was confined to a wheelchair.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.400
The pills I had to take

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.930
were more than my meals.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.110
Besides enduring the pain daily,

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.200
I also had to endure

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.090
the days without you.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.880
Back then, I

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.550
was not looking forward to tomorrow,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.010
and had no idea where my future lay.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:58.960
This Lego set

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.530
kept me company through
those long, difficult days.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.080
It felt like

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.560
you were right there with me.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.260
That was the first time
I desperately wanted to stand up.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.290
And from that moment on,

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.700
I was filled with hope for the future.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.480
I always thought

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.930
we would build these models together.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.960
Back then, I believed

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.170
we had plenty of time

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.760
to build them slowly.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.130
How about

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.600
we take it apart

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.890
and build it for a third time?

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.130
That's not what I meant.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.720
I just feel a bit regretful.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.410
Who's Thomas?

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.110
He's a brilliant student
in our department—

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.110
half-Australian, half-French.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.690
He's pursuing you?

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.460
I've told you before—

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.860
lots of guys are interested in me,

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.810
you just didn't believe it.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.520
I do believe it.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.660

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.680

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.650
I've told you before,

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.930
I'm not a child anymore.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.610
Why are you hiding?

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:10.579
Too shy to look at me?

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.750
No, I'm not.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.230
Then look at me.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.120
You're awake.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.280
Did you sleep well?

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.350
When do you want to move in?

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.430
My lease isn't up until two months later.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:17.270
I can't just waste that money.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.070
Why did you transfer me money?

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.650
Consider it as
you've sublet it to me for two months.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.710
Can you move in now?

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.540
Someone's here to help you move.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.130
Boss,

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:53.910
do we get overtime pay for weekends?

00:20:53.911 --> 00:21:03.911
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:54.520
Yes.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:58.490
Isn't this...

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.710
Hello, I'm Wen Ke.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.790
Just call me Wen.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.130
Hello.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.850
Are you his colleague?

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.610
I'm Mr. Jin's assistant and driver.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.650
Mr. Jin, I'll wait for you downstairs.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.860
Bye-bye.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.890
So you planned this all along.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.010
Wen.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:46.700
Wait in the car for a while.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.380
Come up
after we've packed her things.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:48.900
Okay.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.780
So you have a driver now?

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.460
Why does he call you Mr. Jin?

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.130
Didn't Da Jia and Xiao Jia say

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.130
you aren't working for any company?

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.630
What do you do on your business trips?

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.930
Why do you have so many questions?

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.780
Of course I need to ask.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.690
I can't be with you without knowing

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.020
what your situation is.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.820
Then why didn't you ask last night

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.750
before getting together
with me so carelessly?

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.330
In a situation like last night,

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.410
how could I ask?

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.920
This is my home.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.700
Feel free to look around.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.300
Where was I?

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.710
Last time my drain was broken.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.060
I was going to call the landlord.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.580
But my roommate is really nice.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:44.740
He called his friend to come over.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.860
That friend fixed it in no time.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.930
And then that friend stayed overnight.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.620
How did you know?

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:53.990
Just a guess.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.030
Let's start moving. How should we do it?

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:58.830
I'll help you.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.840
How do we move?

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.370
I don't know where to start.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.170
I hate packing things up.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:11.820
I'll do it from now on.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.370
No way!

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:13.540
If you do everything,

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.000
won't I seem too high-maintenance?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.300
What's wrong with being high-maintenance?

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.700
I'll indulge you anyway.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.580
Really?

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.890
How long do you plan on indulging me?

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.780
A lifetime.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.890
Do you always pack up by yourself?

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.380
What else?

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.420
What about Wen?
Has he been with you all along?

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.510
A few years ago, I went to work
at a factory in Beijing.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.620
After making a name for myself,

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.060
I went
to the Automotive Engineering Institute

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.740
to work on technical engineering
innovations with them.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.600
As for me,
I wanted to work on some small projects,

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.000
so I opened a coffee shop.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.930
I've been a free agent,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.740
while collaborating with them
as a consultant.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.370
At minimum,
I have to go there twice a month.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.740
At most, I go every week.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.610
Considering my health condition,

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.340
a few years ago,

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.780
they assigned me an assistant,

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.820
who is Wen,

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.980
mainly responsible for handling
my business trips.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:28.780
Are all the scarves packed?

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.580
Yes.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.990
I found another one.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.230
That's not a scarf.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.370
It's my skirt.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.060
Where are the sleeves?

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.460
It doesn't need sleeves.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.110
It's a strapless dress.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.740
You just put it on directly.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.160
I can't picture it.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:02.050
Try it on.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:18.980
[Record of my Life]

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:33.650
Don't go.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.970
We don't have a single photo together.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.930
Why don't we take this opportunity?

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.300
Let me set a timer.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:36.830
Let me ask you.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.780
When do you

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.280
usually wear

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.010
this outfit?

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:50.550
When I meet handsome guys.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.220
What makes someone handsome?

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.330
Do I qualify?

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.920
Wen is still waiting downstairs.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:13.490
Wen,

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.140
it'll take us a little longer.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.400
Go back to the coffee shop
and wait for me.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.970
He might get the wrong idea.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:22.600
He won't.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.700
Why not?

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:29.950
Because in his eyes,

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:31.950
I'm a respectable person.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.910
It should be this room.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:58.820
Mr. Jin?

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.800
Mr. Jin?

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.760
Why is everyone here?

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.820
Seeing how you were taking so long,

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.370
I thought you had a lot of stuff to pack.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:11.630
I even called Xiao Jia.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.480
There are quite a few things.
We were just careful with our packing.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.000
Here.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.200
Thanks for your help.

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:19.430
Thank you.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.900
And this one, too.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:25.610
Here. Be careful.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:27.740
I don't know how he manages to do it.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.650
Lying so shamelessly

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:30.930
with a straight face.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.720
Ms. Jiang, you're here.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:56.420
Ms. Jiang?

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.650
It's Boss Lady.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.270
Would you like some coffee?

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:04.490
It's fine. You can go about your business.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:05.950
I just stopped by on my way.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.380
I need to go home for dinner soon.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:07.950
Okay.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.850
Here's the account book.

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.110
All the operations details are in there.

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:25.290
Why are you giving this to me?

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:27.210
It's your own shop.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.410
You should at least know how it's doing.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.540
My shop?

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.740
Since when is it my shop?

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.170
Why else would I bother?

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.670
Do you think opening a coffee shop is fun?

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.990
When I first returned to Nanjing,

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.270
I started planning this coffee shop.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.960
I participated
in designing the environment

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.760
and coming up with the shop name.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:03.490
This place is nice.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:04.740
Thank you for your recommendation.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:05.870
I'm very satisfied.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.830
We can sign the contract anytime.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.770
Sure. Thanks.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:57.960
I've already sent you

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.010
the font for the signature coffee logo.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:00.940
Use the same font

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.290
for the signboard, too.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:04.500
Moon.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:06.700
Moon Coffee.

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:28.790
But I heard that for the first two years,

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:30.739
this place was losing money.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.010
Different trades are worlds apart.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.210
I made some mistakes.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:40.820
Then why

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.750
did you keep pouring money into it?

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.210
Because

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.130
a young girl suggested it
to me many years ago.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:52.409
I'm a very honest person—

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:53.659
almost stubborn.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:55.840
I believe the more mistakes I make,

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.660
the more I will find the right path
eventually.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.060
Even if one day it closes,

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.680
it shouldn't be because
of poor management.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.380
You call yourself honest?

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.670
Then why did you corner me
against the wall back then?

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.780
When did I ever corner you?

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:12.620
At the garage.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.280
You told me to leave

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:17.210
and said it looked bad
that I kept coming to see you.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.490
You even asked

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.780
if I wanted something more with you.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.620
I was just asking casually.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:28.140
Just...

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:42.940
What?

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:45.540
Did I hit a nerve?

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.260
Sorry to disappoint you.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.060
Okay, got it.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.280
Mu.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:20.940
I need to go on an urgent business trip.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:22.270
Wen will take you home.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.520
Be good and wait for me at home,

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.220
okay?
