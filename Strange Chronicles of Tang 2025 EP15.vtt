No, it's too late.

Vicious though that shop was,

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.630
all Madam Master of Rain did there
was dance,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.630
by which she earned a little money
for her family.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.910

I became able to collect
more and more dew,

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.600
Sir!

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.140
You mean me?

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.660
Who are you?

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.120
What a strange costume.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.930
I am the Master of Rain.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:35.900
Just now...

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.510
You were the one praying for rain, right?

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.750
It's a real shame to cover

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.350
your pretty face with a mask.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.630
He seemed to have forgotten our past.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.930
I thought he was joking with me

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.360
and playing dumb.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.880
After all,
he enjoyed doing that as a child.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.780
I then married him with ardent haste.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:02.320
[Wedding]

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.050
After that,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.370
I took him to the Ascension Forest.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.110
I thought,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.390
when we got there,

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.010
he'd stop messing around.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.300
What stupid place is this?

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.510
This is

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.970
where we met in childhood.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.790
How did I meet you in childhood?

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.080
My ancestral home is Xu County, Yingchuan.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.390
I was born in Lantian, Yongzhou.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.250
This is my first time in Chang'an.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.910
Have you been

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.330
with another man before?

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.530
And he looks exactly like me?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.560
How is that possible?

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.720
I get it.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.600
You're lying to me, aren't you?

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.530
In this world, there can't be another man

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.770
as handsome and elegant as I am.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.890
I knew I had made a mistake.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.390
Regrets filled my heart.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.460
But it was too late,

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.470
since I had already married him.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.200
In the first year of our marriage,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.060
we were a loving and happy couple.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.080
But things completely changed
when he failed

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.420
the imperial exam for the first time.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.670
Tell me.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.290
Why did I fail the exam?

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.080
Did you bring me bad luck,

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.390
you female Master of Rain
dressed like a creepy ghost all the time?

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.880
How am I so unfortunate?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.630
Why did I even marry you?

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.920
As the Master of Rain,

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.940
I was often harassed by ruffians.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.490
Instead of protecting me,

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.320
he blamed me
for drawing those guys' attention.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.870
He started humiliating and abusing me

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:27.470
non-stop.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.720
As he failed one exam after another,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.120
the situation got worse.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.530
Half a year ago, he said

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.550
he couldn't live off me forever,

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.520
and that he wanted to find a job.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.040
I was actually glad about it.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.320
But later on,

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.240
I often smelled a scent of rouge

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.310
on his clothes.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.510
Only rich ladies

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.350
could afford that kind of rouge.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.300
I finally realized

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.200
why he worked as a courier

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.960
in an Express Delivery Shop.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:56.270
But what I found even more unbearable

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.470
was that he actually started stealing.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.240
What took you so long?

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.640
Did you hide a man at home?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.360
Sorry, my love.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.770
I was cooking and didn't hear you.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.910
Where did you get this robe?

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.360
I bought it from a secondhand store.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:18.910
How much?

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.890
A few dozen wen.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.240
Just three days' worth of wages
as a courier.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.750
My husband, you must be joking.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.360
Just this turquoise knot button
on the collar

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.560
is worth far more than a few hundred wen.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.370
How many times has it been?

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.630
You must shake off

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.930
the habit of stealing.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.720
You're a jinx, woman.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.380
How dare you tell me what to do?

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.320
You go out once every three days.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.240
What have you been doing?

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.150
Nothing.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.670
Refusing to tell?

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.130
I'll beat you to death!

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.660
That was how I got the scar

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.620
on my forehead.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.600
He scolded me
for going out once every three days,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.810
and it was true.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.000
I made those visits
to the Relief-from-Woes Shop

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.200
for a chance to relieve woes,

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.930
but I never got to tell my story.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.720
Then, the Altar Attendant invited me

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.720
to be the Lamp-Lighting Messenger,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.480
who would perform rituals
before the slaying

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.610
of the Demon of Woes.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.200
It sounded similar
to what the Master of Rain

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.600
would do to pray for rain.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.550
So I agreed.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.160
After all, the pay was good.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.450
I told Chen Qian everything about it.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:29.600
That was too much of a coincidence.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.660
I bet you earned

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.300
all that money by sleeping

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.120
with other men!

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.980
Don't you think I don't know that.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.930
You vile Master of Rain!

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:38.800
Take this!

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.520
It's a letter of divorce.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.170
You jinx, with you out of my way,

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.480
I'll surely pass the imperial exam.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.450
My husband,

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.670
you can't do this to me!

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.680
Go away!

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.400
In despair,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.810
I decided to end my life

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.150
in the Ascension Forest.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.290
My husband?

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.890
Have you changed your mind?

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.370
I'm not that man.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.280
But from today on,

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.970
I can take his place.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.840
I-Is...

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.760
Is it you?

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.030
Will you come collect dew
tomorrow morning?

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.510
Too bad that I can't help you,

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.840
since I'll be occupied.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.290
It really is you.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.250
This is my fault.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.600
I should've come back earlier.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.690
Part of the blame is his.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.850
I didn't expect him

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.430
to come to Chang'an and meet you.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.300
I didn't understand what he said.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.000
When I found that robe

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.400
in the Ascension Forest,

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.010
I was terrified.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.630
You must be tired from collecting dew.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.560
Come have lunch.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.760
I just made it.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:23.800
Who are you?

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.900
About my husband Chen Qian, did you...

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.370
As I said,

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.630
I can replace him.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.850
From now on, I am Chen Qian.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.410
He showed enormous care

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.280
and affection for me.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.200
[Chen Qian]

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.390
He was named Xun Jiao

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.120
and came from a family of assassins.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.750
[Xun Jiao]

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.750
He had a twin.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.600
Feeling reluctant to turn both boys

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.720
into assassins,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.200
his father gave Jiao's twin brother

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.080
to a Chen family in Lantian,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.560
who was then named Chen Qian.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.670
Jiao left Chang'an seven years ago

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.150
because of a task he took on.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.640
He traveled far to the Western Regions

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.980
and various countries

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.280
just to complete that task.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.500
When he came back to Chang'an,

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:17.890
he planned to marry me.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.130
Unexpectedly,

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.250
I had married to Chen Qian by then.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.080
That must be what people call

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.860
"the irony of fate."

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.390
[Just and Selfless]

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.990
This seems like
what the Crimson Pact would do.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.480
They actually spent as long as seven years

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.810
in completing an assassination mission.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.170
It wouldn't be a surprise
if they established

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.910
the Relief-from-Woes Shop

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.630
for the purpose of killing the Emperor.
