‎PREVIOUSLY ON ‎CHOSEN HOME

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:06.177
Gentle-hearted gay man Genichi Hatano

00:00:06.244 --> 00:00:08.046
and his partner Saku Sakuta,

00:00:08.613 --> 00:00:11.149
end up forming a parent-child contract
with Hotaru Kusunoki.

00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:13.985
As Hotaru wants to make guitars
after middle school,

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:15.453
-the three set out for Nagano
-I'll be off now.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.489
for the sake of her dream.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.191
Just a little more to go.

00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:21.092
CRAFTSMEN WANTED

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:26.664
Are you okay?

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:28.800
Hello?

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.508
Let's take a little break, shall we?

00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:40.745
My heart is kind of racing…

00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:42.647
Mr. Sakuta.

00:00:42.714 --> 00:00:45.216
My hands are shaking
even though it’s not cold.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.719
You’re just nervous.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.554
Want to practice?

00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:50.722
Practice what?

00:00:51.823 --> 00:00:54.392
I’ll be the person at the guitar workshop.

00:00:58.663 --> 00:01:00.265
Hello, welcome.

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:04.769
I’m from Zenpukuji Middle School in Tokyo.

00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:06.237
My name is Hotaru Kusunoki.

00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:10.108
Why did you want to come
tour our workshop?

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:11.209
I…

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:14.712
want to be a guitar maker in the future.

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:16.147
I hope I can.

00:01:16.214 --> 00:01:18.583
I read the pamphlet for your guitars

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.453
and felt really inspired so I wanted
to come and take a look.

00:01:23.488 --> 00:01:24.656
Perfect!

00:01:27.258 --> 00:01:28.927
WINNER

00:01:28.993 --> 00:01:30.428
Even the gods say you'll be fine.

00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:34.599
NO PRIZE

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.100
We're a match.

00:01:40.672 --> 00:01:44.142
Thanks for having us. I’m Sakuta,
we spoke before regarding the tour.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.010
I’m the head of this workshop.

00:01:46.077 --> 00:01:47.078
My name is Yasuo Kishibe.

00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:49.681
I came from Zenpukuji Middle School.

00:01:49.747 --> 00:01:50.882
My name is Hotaru Kusunoki.

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:53.585
This is my homeroom teacher, Mr. Sakuta…

00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:55.820
-And I'm her attendant, Hatano.
-I see.

00:01:56.454 --> 00:01:58.189
Um, I read your pamphlet,

00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:00.658
but I can’t actually play
the guitar at all.

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:02.660
Could I still learn to make them?

00:02:02.727 --> 00:02:03.695
Could I work here?

00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:06.598
We’d really appreciate any guidance
you could give this child.

00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:08.766
Calm down, the both of you.

00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:11.269
In any case,

00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:12.971
why don’t we go take a look inside?

00:02:13.037 --> 00:02:13.905
Okay.

00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:19.043
TOBISHIMA

00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:22.180
Do all of these become guitars?

00:02:22.247 --> 00:02:23.414
That's right.

00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:26.317
Even the ones with knots like this.

00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:27.885
Really?

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.823
We think things like that
give it character.

00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:34.726
If they all looked the same,
it’d be boring, no?

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:35.693
True.

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:39.931
Do you know how a guitar makes sound?

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:41.699
The strings get plucked…?

00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:44.102
The vibration then travels
to the top plate…

00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:46.537
And the air inside vibrates too.

00:02:46.604 --> 00:02:47.438
Exactly.

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.008
All of it works together.

00:02:50.074 --> 00:02:51.809
So every part matters.

00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:54.846
We do adjustments depending on the wood,
taking it slow,

00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:58.249
and that’s how you shape it
into a clean guitar body.

00:02:58.316 --> 00:03:00.485
Rush it or force it,

00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:01.519
and it’ll crack.

00:03:02.654 --> 00:03:04.355
That step affects things such as the tone

00:03:04.422 --> 00:03:06.958
and strength of a guitar.
It’s a crucial step.

00:03:07.558 --> 00:03:10.695
For us, good sound is a given.

00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:12.664
But we also make guitars
that last a long time

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.699
and grow with the person who plays them.

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:17.635
Those are the kind of guitars
we're aiming for.

00:03:17.702 --> 00:03:19.771
Do guitars grow?

00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:21.773
Even with the same guitar,

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.542
the sound changes
depending on how you play it.

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.911
It becomes a tone
only that person can make.

00:03:27.845 --> 00:03:30.214
I wonder if that’s true
for Mr. Hatano's guitar too.

00:03:30.748 --> 00:03:31.716
It has a good sound?

00:03:33.217 --> 00:03:34.952
It's a sound that I like.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.654
I see now.

00:03:37.155 --> 00:03:39.157
So that’s why you want to make guitars.

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.061
Any thoughts after the tour?

00:03:43.795 --> 00:03:45.096
I want to work here.

00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:46.998
I don’t know if I'm up for the task,

00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:49.100
but I want to learn to make guitars too.

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:51.569
And after listening to you,

00:03:51.636 --> 00:03:53.438
the things you value here

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:55.907
is something I'd like to value as well.

00:03:56.774 --> 00:03:58.443
Thank you. But…

00:03:59.077 --> 00:04:01.479
You won’t be making guitars right away.

00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:04.749
First you learn the structure.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.051
Then how to read and make blueprints,

00:04:07.652 --> 00:04:09.153
study design,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.622
learn the tools and practice…

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.759
Before you can make anything decent,

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:16.694
it’ll take at least ten years.

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:20.698
More so than you expect, Ms. Kusunoki,

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.901
I think you'll probably face
many challenges.

00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:27.238
Even so, do you still want to work here?

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.341
-Take your time and think--
-I want to work here!

00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:33.378
-What?
-I want to work here!

00:04:33.444 --> 00:04:34.812
Please!

00:04:37.048 --> 00:04:39.984
Um, I think Hotaru is a resilient kid.

00:04:40.618 --> 00:04:43.654
I agree too, as her homeroom teacher.

00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:46.224
To be specific about Hotaru’s good points,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.093
first, she has good table manners.

00:04:49.594 --> 00:04:50.661
Also,

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:53.564
she’s really good
at gently petting animals.

00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:55.199
And, uh,

00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:57.769
-the first time she played the gui--
-That's enough!

00:04:57.835 --> 00:04:58.669
Sorry.

00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:02.106
Very well.

00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:05.176
Those who have a sound they love…

00:05:05.943 --> 00:05:07.745
are those who can push through.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.881
It's our pleasure

00:05:09.947 --> 00:05:11.416
to have you with us!

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.619
Thank you!

00:05:17.622 --> 00:05:20.691
You said you wanted to see
the finished guitars too, right?

00:05:20.758 --> 00:05:21.692
Yes.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.594
Hey, Kazuki!

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:25.062
Come here for a bit.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.231
This is my grandson.

00:05:27.799 --> 00:05:29.300
He helps out sometimes.

00:05:30.902 --> 00:05:33.037
Show them the exhibition room, would you?

00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:34.772
Okay. This way, please.

00:05:35.673 --> 00:05:37.141
-Thank you.
-Um!

00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:40.545
I have one more thing to ask you.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.550
All the guitars we make
mostly end up displayed here.

00:05:46.584 --> 00:05:48.719
Feel free to get a feel or play them.

00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:51.889
I can’t play.

00:05:52.757 --> 00:05:53.958
Sorry.

00:05:55.193 --> 00:05:57.495
Playing and making are totally different.

00:05:57.995 --> 00:05:59.397
It's fine even if you can't play.

00:05:59.964 --> 00:06:01.365
Thank you.

00:06:04.402 --> 00:06:05.436
Actually, that’s a lie.

00:06:06.404 --> 00:06:08.406
Everyone here can play,

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.608
so it might help to know a bit.

00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:12.109
Huh?

00:06:12.743 --> 00:06:15.913
If you’re different from everyone else,
doesn’t it feel awkward?

00:06:17.315 --> 00:06:20.017
Do you ever feel awkward?

00:06:23.054 --> 00:06:24.622
This is cute!

00:06:26.123 --> 00:06:28.559
Excuse me. Can I get three of these?

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:30.027
Thank you.

00:06:30.528 --> 00:06:32.797
That'll be 12,000 yen.

00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:34.866
Here you go.

00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:36.634
That's the exact amount.

00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:37.702
Why three?

00:06:38.503 --> 00:06:39.637
What are you doing?

00:06:39.704 --> 00:06:41.539
For you. Here you go.

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.174
You too.

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:44.809
Now we all match.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.578
You’re very close, aren’t you?
That’s good.

00:06:49.213 --> 00:06:51.315
Okay then. We’ll be waiting for you.

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:53.117
Thank you.

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:01.893
-Thanks for your help.
-Yeah.

00:07:03.828 --> 00:07:06.230
Kazuki! Hey, Kazuki!

00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:08.366
-Mind if we ask something?
-Yeah?

00:07:08.432 --> 00:07:10.034
Who was that girl earlier?

00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:11.469
She came to tour the workshop.

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:14.739
-Love is finally in the air for you!
-It's nothing like that.

00:07:14.805 --> 00:07:16.807
But is she your type though?

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.545
Well, I guess so.

00:07:20.611 --> 00:07:22.179
That’s the first time Kazuki said that!

00:07:22.246 --> 00:07:23.548
We'll be cheering for you!

00:07:23.614 --> 00:07:24.448
Isn't that right?

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:33.958
I’ll work really hard.

00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:36.794
It might take a long time,

00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:38.596
but I want to be able to make guitars.

00:07:39.297 --> 00:07:41.432
And when I do, Mr. Hatano, please play it.

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:42.333
Sure.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.269
Mr. Sakuta can then listen.

00:07:45.336 --> 00:07:47.638
We'll have to live a long life then, huh.

00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:52.643
Take a look at this, Hotaru.

00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:56.047
-Here.
-There’s a high school near the workshop.

00:07:56.113 --> 00:07:58.482
It has a night program too.

00:07:58.549 --> 00:08:00.585
I spoke with Mr. Kishibe

00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:03.487
and he said it’d be fine
to work while schooling.

00:08:03.988 --> 00:08:07.491
His grandson Kazuki
is in the regular course there too.

00:08:08.225 --> 00:08:09.827
Work and school,

00:08:09.894 --> 00:08:12.463
Sakuta really wants you to go for both--

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.699
-Hey!
-Sorry.

00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:17.001
You get to decide, of course.

00:08:17.702 --> 00:08:19.370
Just know that option exists.

00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:20.871
Thank you.

00:08:21.472 --> 00:08:22.506
Don't mention it.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.177
U-Um, can we make a quick detour?

00:08:26.777 --> 00:08:29.780
NAGANO SOUVENIR

00:08:33.718 --> 00:08:34.652
Wait, isn't this?

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:37.521
I found it while sorting through
the apartment listings this morning,

00:08:37.588 --> 00:08:38.623
and I kept it in my pocket.

00:08:39.256 --> 00:08:40.291
Hey, wait!

00:08:40.992 --> 00:08:41.859
What's the matter?

00:08:41.926 --> 00:08:43.527
I should be asking you that.

00:08:43.594 --> 00:08:44.428
Are you okay with it?

00:08:45.229 --> 00:08:47.999
I’m throwing it away
properly myself this time.

00:08:48.065 --> 00:08:49.400
Yeah, but

00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:52.236
you should part
with important things properly.

00:08:52.303 --> 00:08:53.871
What do you mean by that?

00:08:54.438 --> 00:08:55.406
Well…

00:08:58.109 --> 00:08:59.143
NAGANO PREFECTURE

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.211
I found it.

00:09:08.953 --> 00:09:09.954
Coming.

00:09:12.657 --> 00:09:13.491
Are things okay?

00:09:14.225 --> 00:09:16.794
Once I’m done getting ready,
I’ll go to the police.

00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:19.230
Before that, I called Ms. Matsu.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:20.998
Who's that?

00:09:21.065 --> 00:09:23.300
She's the officer I mentioned before.

00:09:23.801 --> 00:09:24.869
You can trust her.

00:09:25.436 --> 00:09:26.704
She'll look out for you, Tomoe.

00:09:26.771 --> 00:09:28.806
I believe Ms. Matsu
will take this seriously.

00:09:29.373 --> 00:09:30.207
I see.

00:09:31.542 --> 00:09:33.544
Speaking of the devil,

00:09:33.611 --> 00:09:34.578
she's here.

00:09:36.147 --> 00:09:39.650
I understand the circumstances of the
embezzlement and your reason for fleeing.

00:09:40.518 --> 00:09:43.320
To ensure you’re not treated unfairly,

00:09:43.387 --> 00:09:46.857
I’ll explain clearly
to the investigating officer.

00:09:46.924 --> 00:09:48.859
So when you give
your statement at the station,

00:09:48.926 --> 00:09:50.394
please be honest.

00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:51.429
I understand.

00:09:52.196 --> 00:09:55.232
The 32,261,570 yen that you took

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:58.002
is all in there?

00:09:58.069 --> 00:09:58.903
Yes.

00:09:58.969 --> 00:10:01.439
Were all your belongings stolen
during your escape?

00:10:02.306 --> 00:10:05.142
But my wallet was in my pocket.

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:07.278
Then you should bring that with you too.

00:10:07.344 --> 00:10:08.979
Okay.

00:10:14.118 --> 00:10:15.953
Don’t throw any of those away.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.822
I'm just organizing them.

00:10:17.888 --> 00:10:19.457
By date, at least.

00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:23.527
You’re quite the meticulous fugitive.

00:10:24.028 --> 00:10:26.697
It's an old habit from accounting work
that I still have with me.

00:10:26.764 --> 00:10:27.665
RECEIPTS

00:10:27.732 --> 00:10:30.267
Most of these are receipts
for keychains, huh?

00:10:30.935 --> 00:10:32.536
Wait, what about this one?

00:10:33.337 --> 00:10:36.640
Stomach medicine at a pharmacy in Kagawa?

00:10:36.707 --> 00:10:38.709
I thought I’d save money

00:10:38.776 --> 00:10:40.811
and I tried eating some plants
by the roadside,

00:10:40.878 --> 00:10:42.279
but it gave me a stomachache.

00:10:42.346 --> 00:10:43.714
You’re wild.

00:10:44.815 --> 00:10:47.218
This one is from a supermarket in Iwate,

00:10:47.284 --> 00:10:48.419
and you purchased soy sauce.

00:10:48.486 --> 00:10:50.821
I went fishing
with some folks at the port,

00:10:50.888 --> 00:10:52.356
and they gave me sashimi.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.560
Kumamoto, Fukushima…

00:10:56.627 --> 00:10:58.062
And Okinawa too.

00:10:58.129 --> 00:11:01.165
You’ve been to a lot of places.

00:11:01.232 --> 00:11:02.967
If I wanted to go somewhere,

00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:04.935
I could just go.

00:11:05.503 --> 00:11:06.537
Really?

00:11:06.604 --> 00:11:09.840
I used to think it was impossible,
but surprisingly it wasn't.

00:11:11.008 --> 00:11:13.711
Then maybe I could go anywhere too?

00:11:13.778 --> 00:11:14.612
What?

00:11:14.678 --> 00:11:16.080
I've…

00:11:16.147 --> 00:11:19.183
been here for so long.

00:11:19.917 --> 00:11:21.919
So I can’t really imagine myself

00:11:21.986 --> 00:11:23.954
being anywhere else.

00:11:25.189 --> 00:11:27.091
But after seeing this, you know?

00:11:27.758 --> 00:11:29.059
Maybe I can.

00:11:31.796 --> 00:11:33.831
Sorry, Ms. Matsu.

00:11:33.898 --> 00:11:37.601
I told one little lie earlier.

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:39.370
What?

00:11:41.405 --> 00:11:42.473
-Ah!
-Oh dear!

00:11:45.743 --> 00:11:46.877
Is something wrong?

00:11:48.712 --> 00:11:51.148
Can I lie about my job here?

00:11:51.215 --> 00:11:53.484
What are you saying?
Of course you can’t do that.

00:11:53.551 --> 00:11:56.821
Then what should I write
if I'm a day laborer?

00:11:56.887 --> 00:11:57.988
Oh.

00:11:59.056 --> 00:12:00.324
In that case,

00:12:00.391 --> 00:12:03.093
it might be tough to find a place.

00:12:03.928 --> 00:12:04.895
Are you serious?

00:12:04.962 --> 00:12:06.330
Then, find me a job!

00:12:06.897 --> 00:12:08.966
Even if you say that…

00:12:09.033 --> 00:12:10.100
This guy

00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:12.303
has been eating less than before.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.238
I researched and…

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:15.906
it might be stress.

00:12:16.707 --> 00:12:19.977
He’s sensitive, so a safe room
with the right temperature

00:12:20.044 --> 00:12:21.846
and cleanliness is really important.

00:12:22.513 --> 00:12:23.447
That's why!

00:12:23.514 --> 00:12:25.482
I gave up on a lot of things for myself,

00:12:25.983 --> 00:12:27.318
but for this little guy,

00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:29.186
the house…

00:12:29.687 --> 00:12:31.689
is something I just can't compromise on!

00:12:31.755 --> 00:12:32.923
That's what I thought.

00:12:34.525 --> 00:12:37.428
Perfect. That’s good. One more time.

00:12:37.494 --> 00:12:38.562
Huh? What?

00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:40.164
Actually, I started this…

00:12:40.831 --> 00:12:42.700
"House-Hunting Struggles: Real Stories."

00:12:42.766 --> 00:12:46.237
Most interviews of this kind
show only successful people, right?

00:12:46.303 --> 00:12:49.106
So I thought I’d interview people
who are still unsure.

00:12:49.173 --> 00:12:51.442
Would that even be helpful?

00:12:51.508 --> 00:12:54.745
I think it could definitely
help someone out there.

00:12:58.249 --> 00:12:59.884
"It can help someone," he says.

00:13:00.484 --> 00:13:02.620
Want to join me for the interview then?

00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:05.489
"House-Hunting Struggles: Real Stories
brought to you by Okabe."

00:13:05.556 --> 00:13:06.724
Sure.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:07.758
Good to hear.

00:13:08.325 --> 00:13:11.395
It's about a gay couple
looking for a home, right?

00:13:11.462 --> 00:13:12.663
That's right.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.066
And about the photos, are you okay
if it’s just from the neck down?

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.869
If they're going with that, I don't mind.

00:13:19.536 --> 00:13:22.072
Then why don’t we wear this at that time?

00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:24.508
Like a couple look.
Even if our faces aren’t shown,

00:13:24.575 --> 00:13:25.976
we can show our lovey-dovey vibe.

00:13:26.043 --> 00:13:28.846
Hell no! Never!

00:13:28.913 --> 00:13:29.813
What?

00:13:30.848 --> 00:13:32.549
Please leave it there.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.918
Sorry about this.

00:13:37.521 --> 00:13:40.457
So what was the lie?

00:13:42.693 --> 00:13:44.094
That…

00:13:45.763 --> 00:13:47.464
I embezzled because

00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:49.133
I wanted to be a mom who didn’t

00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:50.901
want her child to worry about money.

00:13:51.468 --> 00:13:52.736
And that I ran away

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.372
to chase my dreams.

00:13:55.439 --> 00:13:57.041
Those were lies?

00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:00.611
While talking earlier, I realized…

00:14:02.379 --> 00:14:03.881
Thinking about myself,

00:14:04.848 --> 00:14:07.851
and going wherever I wanted each day…

00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:10.120
It was fun.

00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:13.290
But in the end…

00:14:13.791 --> 00:14:16.694
maybe I just wanted to quit.

00:14:17.194 --> 00:14:18.696
Quit being a mom,

00:14:18.762 --> 00:14:20.564
quit being an accounting temp…

00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:22.633
I just wanted to wreck it all

00:14:23.233 --> 00:14:25.202
and walk away from all of it.

00:14:29.473 --> 00:14:30.741
I’m sorry.

00:14:31.342 --> 00:14:33.177
I really am the worst.

00:14:33.243 --> 00:14:34.712
You are.

00:14:35.212 --> 00:14:36.513
Yes.

00:14:37.414 --> 00:14:39.850
But I kind of understand you, Mrs. Tomoe.

00:14:39.917 --> 00:14:41.151
Sometimes at work,

00:14:41.218 --> 00:14:42.653
I wish a bomb would fall

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.655
so I could have the day off.

00:14:44.722 --> 00:14:46.623
You think about that, Ms. Matsu?

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.459
-Sometimes.
-Oh!

00:14:48.525 --> 00:14:49.927
Like, when you see the trees

00:14:49.994 --> 00:14:51.929
or flowers you really love in the garden,

00:14:51.996 --> 00:14:56.133
but today
watering them feels like a chore…

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.668
Your feelings are like that, yes?

00:14:57.735 --> 00:14:58.602
Exactly!

00:15:00.237 --> 00:15:01.271
Seems like a no.

00:15:01.772 --> 00:15:05.909
Uh, thank you. You can stop there.

00:15:09.613 --> 00:15:10.748
Maybe…

00:15:11.248 --> 00:15:13.650
I should've said all this sooner.

00:15:15.052 --> 00:15:17.154
I should've meddled more too.

00:15:17.221 --> 00:15:19.656
Maybe then I could’ve told you

00:15:19.723 --> 00:15:21.425
"you’re the worst" sooner.

00:15:21.492 --> 00:15:23.427
I was the one who is at fault.

00:15:23.494 --> 00:15:24.862
No need to blame yourself.

00:15:25.696 --> 00:15:26.697
That’s not true.

00:15:27.264 --> 00:15:28.499
Not at all.

00:15:30.567 --> 00:15:34.171
I know I probably can’t undo
what’s been done.

00:15:34.972 --> 00:15:36.040
But still…

00:15:36.707 --> 00:15:37.875
the things I've broken,

00:15:38.609 --> 00:15:41.578
I want to fix them one at a time.

00:15:59.229 --> 00:16:00.064
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.632
Thank you for driving us back.

00:16:01.698 --> 00:16:03.200
Thank you.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.835
Don't mention it.

00:16:09.073 --> 00:16:09.973
Is something wrong?

00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:12.976
Has Mom…

00:16:13.544 --> 00:16:15.179
already left?

00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.461
WELCOME BACK

00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:33.330
I'm back.

00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:43.807
Thank you for the food.

00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:47.911
1. APPLICATION PERIOD
2. DATES FOR ACADEMIC EXAMINATIONS

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.150
ENTRANCE EXAM

00:16:53.217 --> 00:16:54.318
Next.

00:16:54.384 --> 00:16:57.054
"Agree with" means to have
the same opinion of something.

00:16:57.121 --> 00:16:57.955
That's correct.

00:16:59.156 --> 00:17:01.158
You can do it! I know you can!

00:17:01.658 --> 00:17:03.293
Hotaru!

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.495
Thanks.

00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:06.430
But Nagano, huh?

00:17:06.497 --> 00:17:07.531
Where’s that again?

00:17:08.465 --> 00:17:11.335
-Here.
-Oh, it's near then.

00:17:11.835 --> 00:17:14.972
Oh, you got a notification
saying something about yearbook.

00:17:16.206 --> 00:17:18.275
"For the collage page in the yearbook,

00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:21.378
please submit a photo of you."

00:17:21.445 --> 00:17:24.281
But I don’t have any photos anyway,
so I’ll just ignore it.

00:17:24.348 --> 00:17:26.617
What? Want me to take one for you then?

00:17:26.683 --> 00:17:27.885
With us in it?

00:17:27.951 --> 00:17:28.785
Oh!

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.188
That's a nice idea.

00:17:32.589 --> 00:17:34.491
-Nice hoodies.
-Right?

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:36.460
This guy is persistent.

00:17:36.527 --> 00:17:37.661
Totally against my will.

00:17:40.397 --> 00:17:42.599
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

00:17:44.101 --> 00:17:46.670
What the hell. It’s you two, huh?

00:17:46.737 --> 00:17:47.971
That’s our line!

00:17:48.038 --> 00:17:49.873
He works for us

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.008
as a driver now.

00:17:51.842 --> 00:17:54.545
He takes clients to viewings and all that,

00:17:55.045 --> 00:17:56.180
and he’s pretty well-liked.

00:17:57.147 --> 00:17:59.516
You look kind of nice now.

00:17:59.583 --> 00:18:00.984
Your hair, your clothes, etc.

00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:02.553
I started taking care of my looks.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.922
To take proper care of a rabbit,

00:18:04.988 --> 00:18:06.924
I also have to look after myself.

00:18:07.558 --> 00:18:09.059
Is that how it works?

00:18:09.126 --> 00:18:11.562
I'll be taking a break
before my next task.

00:18:11.628 --> 00:18:12.663
Noted.

00:18:14.531 --> 00:18:16.033
I'm back.

00:18:16.099 --> 00:18:17.034
Such a cutie.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:17.935
HOUSE-HUNTING STRUGGLES: REAL STORIES

00:18:18.001 --> 00:18:20.237
Why did you decide to buy a house
in the first place?

00:18:20.304 --> 00:18:21.638
Well…

00:18:21.705 --> 00:18:23.840
Because you saw
the marriage registration form, yes?

00:18:24.708 --> 00:18:25.876
What?

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.479
The marriage registration form
I’d filled out with my ex,

00:18:29.546 --> 00:18:31.448
Hatano saw it by chance.

00:18:31.515 --> 00:18:34.084
Just when I was saying things like,

00:18:34.151 --> 00:18:36.353
"It doesn’t matter
since we can’t file it,"

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.021
Hatano said, "Instead of marriage,

00:18:38.088 --> 00:18:40.691
how about buying a house as a 'clamp'?"

00:18:40.757 --> 00:18:42.693
I see how it is now.

00:18:43.393 --> 00:18:44.828
You guys…

00:18:44.895 --> 00:18:47.231
Why are you so hung up
on getting married anyway?

00:18:47.297 --> 00:18:48.131
What?

00:18:48.198 --> 00:18:50.300
Getting married
doesn’t guarantee happiness.

00:18:51.501 --> 00:18:54.338
I also don’t believe that marriage

00:18:54.838 --> 00:18:56.540
is something absolute

00:18:56.607 --> 00:18:59.042
or a symbol of happiness.

00:18:59.676 --> 00:19:02.012
I just want to be recognized.

00:19:02.779 --> 00:19:04.248
Just like everybody else,

00:19:04.314 --> 00:19:07.517
whether to get married or not,
I want to be able to choose.

00:19:08.085 --> 00:19:10.153
That would mean

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.422
we’re allowed to be who we are.

00:19:12.489 --> 00:19:13.957
That's how I see it.

00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:16.960
I don't get it.

00:19:17.027 --> 00:19:18.095
Mr. Ichigaya.

00:19:18.595 --> 00:19:20.063
Remind me again

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.598
why you two can’t get married.

00:19:22.199 --> 00:19:24.601
-Who cares, right?
-Huh?

00:19:24.668 --> 00:19:26.336
If you can’t get married,

00:19:26.837 --> 00:19:28.438
then just make it so you can.

00:19:29.273 --> 00:19:30.140
Start a revolution.

00:19:31.208 --> 00:19:32.676
"Love and revolution", yes?

00:19:34.211 --> 00:19:37.147
-You're right!
-You’re making fun of us, aren’t you?

00:19:37.214 --> 00:19:39.616
Not my problem anyway.
Anyway, I’m heading out.

00:19:40.417 --> 00:19:42.152
-See you.
-Goodbye.

00:19:42.219 --> 00:19:43.120
Bye.

00:19:50.027 --> 00:19:52.029
Over here! Hurry.

00:19:52.095 --> 00:19:54.264
THIS IS THE REAR GATE. PLEASE USE
MAIN ENTRANCE. NO UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES

00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:56.767
Are you sure you’re okay
with us being in the yearbook?

00:19:56.833 --> 00:19:58.869
Hey, you think we can fool them with this?

00:19:58.935 --> 00:20:01.138
-I don't know.
-Hey, look!

00:20:02.205 --> 00:20:04.441
Don't I look good in this?

00:20:04.508 --> 00:20:05.942
During break,

00:20:06.009 --> 00:20:08.211
I've always wanted to hang out
at someone’s desk and talk.

00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:09.713
I've…

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.715
always wanted to borrow the textbook

00:20:11.782 --> 00:20:13.717
from the person sitting next to me.

00:20:13.784 --> 00:20:16.186
I've always wanted to do
a full-on sprint down the hallway!

00:20:18.889 --> 00:20:20.223
-Huh?
-…Until

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.427
a teacher yells at me!

00:20:23.493 --> 00:20:24.328
Hey!

00:20:24.394 --> 00:20:26.229
Look at him.

00:20:27.564 --> 00:20:29.266
It looks like we're wearing uniforms.

00:20:29.333 --> 00:20:31.234
-Ah!
-What?

00:20:31.735 --> 00:20:34.371
What about you, Nacchi?
Anything you wanted to do at school?

00:20:35.472 --> 00:20:37.407
Maybe go on a school trip.

00:20:38.075 --> 00:20:41.511
A school trip is kinda tough, huh?

00:20:42.946 --> 00:20:45.082
Then we’ll save that for next time.

00:20:45.582 --> 00:20:46.550
What do you mean?

00:20:47.084 --> 00:20:48.585
Next time, let's do it.

00:20:49.152 --> 00:20:50.087
It's a promise!

00:20:51.621 --> 00:20:52.689
Promise!

00:20:56.727 --> 00:20:57.561
Seriously?

00:20:57.627 --> 00:20:58.829
You mean it?

00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:08.805
GAY

00:21:09.373 --> 00:21:10.607
Kazuki!

00:21:10.674 --> 00:21:12.342
Yeah?

00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:14.578
Could you please show me your math notes?

00:21:14.644 --> 00:21:15.545
What?

00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:18.548
I slept like a log in class.

00:21:18.615 --> 00:21:19.916
There’s a quiz tomorrow, right?

00:21:20.884 --> 00:21:21.952
Please!

00:21:23.387 --> 00:21:24.888
Only if you buy me juice.

00:21:24.955 --> 00:21:26.723
Really? I'll totally do that!

00:21:27.224 --> 00:21:28.692
Thanks!

00:21:28.759 --> 00:21:31.027
You're gonna be called gay if you do that.

00:21:31.094 --> 00:21:32.796
-I'll go get my notes from class.
-Okay.

00:21:32.863 --> 00:21:34.030
Gross!

00:21:34.798 --> 00:21:36.066
Gross…

00:21:36.133 --> 00:21:38.135
So gross, damn it!

00:21:39.803 --> 00:21:41.838
I'm really so disgusting!

00:21:44.307 --> 00:21:46.309
How many shishamo will you eat?

00:21:48.745 --> 00:21:50.147
Three? Got it.

00:21:51.782 --> 00:21:53.383
The fire seems a little low.

00:21:54.151 --> 00:21:55.485
If that's the case,

00:21:55.552 --> 00:21:57.788
just add some scrap paper.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.025
It was still in my pocket.

00:22:02.092 --> 00:22:03.493
If you want, use this.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.229
No, that’s too important…

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.633
Grilling Hotaru’s shishamo properly
is important too.

00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:12.302
You're right.

00:22:13.069 --> 00:22:14.237
That's why…

00:22:15.605 --> 00:22:16.506
There.

00:22:21.778 --> 00:22:22.679
It's grilling well.

00:22:27.484 --> 00:22:28.518
Hatano.

00:22:29.519 --> 00:22:30.520
A marriage registration form…

00:22:31.555 --> 00:22:33.223
Want to fill it out with me?

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.891
What? Of course.

00:22:35.392 --> 00:22:36.393
Let's do it.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.564
After that, let's go file it.

00:22:42.566 --> 00:22:43.467
Huh?

00:22:45.068 --> 00:22:47.971
To the ward office.
Our marriage registration form.

00:22:48.672 --> 00:22:49.773
Let’s go file it.

00:22:53.743 --> 00:22:54.578
Okay.

00:22:57.581 --> 00:22:59.216
Congratulations!

00:22:59.282 --> 00:23:00.484
-Congratulations.
-So cute!

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.419
What are you guys celebrating for?

00:23:02.486 --> 00:23:03.320
Haven’t you seen?

00:23:03.386 --> 00:23:05.755
The results of
the animal illustration contest.

00:23:05.822 --> 00:23:06.656
It's already out.

00:23:06.723 --> 00:23:10.393
ANIMAL ILLUSTRATION CONTEST RESULTS

00:23:12.462 --> 00:23:13.864
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.266
You entered the contest too, Ms. Momose?

00:23:16.333 --> 00:23:18.201
I did the modelling.

00:23:18.268 --> 00:23:20.570
The Toyoko kids drew me.

00:23:20.637 --> 00:23:22.305
What, Toyoko?

00:23:22.806 --> 00:23:23.874
Is this you, Ms. Momose?

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.476
Yes, it feels strange.

00:23:26.543 --> 00:23:28.278
All four are drawn differently,

00:23:28.345 --> 00:23:29.579
but all are me.

00:23:30.146 --> 00:23:31.615
Which one do you like the most?

00:23:32.182 --> 00:23:33.650
-The most?
-Yes.

00:23:37.254 --> 00:23:38.355
To decide on that,

00:23:38.421 --> 00:23:40.824
you need to be very firm about it.

00:23:41.658 --> 00:23:42.492
Oh?

00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:43.593
NACCHI, HOTARU KUSUNOKI, BAYASHIKO

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.661
HOTARU KUSUNOKI

00:23:45.495 --> 00:23:46.396
Wait.

00:23:46.463 --> 00:23:49.099
Haven’t we seen this person
before somewhere?

00:23:50.534 --> 00:23:52.369
That’s me.

00:23:54.704 --> 00:23:56.439
It's kind of embarrassing,

00:23:56.506 --> 00:23:57.340
but it's a self-portrait.

00:23:57.407 --> 00:23:59.209
Impressive! Congratulations!

00:23:59.276 --> 00:24:01.311
It looks great!
Can’t put my finger on it though.

00:24:01.378 --> 00:24:02.212
You can tell?

00:24:02.979 --> 00:24:04.314
Which part do you like?

00:24:04.381 --> 00:24:05.815
One second.

00:24:05.882 --> 00:24:07.684
Try comparing it.

00:24:07.751 --> 00:24:08.919
You’ll see a difference.

00:24:12.689 --> 00:24:13.790
This doesn’t have a ring.

00:24:13.857 --> 00:24:15.358
-Correct!
-I see!

00:24:16.426 --> 00:24:19.496
It somehow feels more natural that way.

00:24:20.797 --> 00:24:22.866
I've always wanted to take it off…

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.402
Looking at myself, I finally realized it.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:27.671
I see.

00:24:27.737 --> 00:24:28.672
Though…

00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:31.775
in reality, things don’t go so smoothly.

00:24:32.375 --> 00:24:34.444
Not being able to remove that

00:24:34.511 --> 00:24:36.379
is not entirely your fault, Yoshida.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.416
People in the past who hurt you,

00:24:39.482 --> 00:24:41.851
the people around you,

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:44.821
and society itself,
I think those are at fault too.

00:24:45.589 --> 00:24:47.190
Even so…

00:24:47.791 --> 00:24:48.892
That’s why I’m going to…

00:24:49.459 --> 00:24:51.494
file a marriage registration form
with Sakuta.

00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:52.796
-What?
-What?

00:24:52.862 --> 00:24:54.598
We might get hurt,

00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:56.633
and it might just end there…

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.702
Is that Mr. Hatano's

00:24:58.768 --> 00:25:00.637
"love and revolution"?

00:25:02.105 --> 00:25:03.039
Yes.

00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:07.210
It was Sakuta's idea, though.

00:25:12.682 --> 00:25:14.417
-Got your hand warmer?
-Yeah.

00:25:14.484 --> 00:25:16.052
-What about your exam slip?
-Yeah.

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:17.687
-What about your charm?
-Here.

00:25:17.754 --> 00:25:19.689
-Good luck!
-Thanks, I’m off.

00:25:27.397 --> 00:25:28.898
Did you pack your water bottle?

00:25:42.445 --> 00:25:43.747
Alright, time’s up.

00:25:43.813 --> 00:25:46.683
Put your pens down
and turn your papers over.

00:25:47.884 --> 00:25:48.818
Nice work.

00:25:50.553 --> 00:25:51.821
ENTRANCE EXAMINATION VENUE

00:25:51.888 --> 00:25:52.856
Nice work in there.

00:25:52.922 --> 00:25:53.990
Thank you.

00:25:54.057 --> 00:25:55.125
-Nice work.
-Thank you.

00:25:55.191 --> 00:25:56.993
-Thank you so much.
-Nice work.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.862
-Thank you so much.
-Get home safely.

00:25:59.362 --> 00:26:00.196
Good work today.

00:26:18.782 --> 00:26:20.417
So how’d it go?

00:26:21.184 --> 00:26:22.118
As for solar eclipses,

00:26:22.185 --> 00:26:23.887
revolution, and rotation, those I knew.

00:26:25.155 --> 00:26:26.122
That's it?

00:26:26.189 --> 00:26:28.625
In any case, you made it back home safely.

00:26:28.692 --> 00:26:29.693
I'm glad about that.

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:31.528
-Good job today.
-Yeah.

00:26:33.863 --> 00:26:35.765
-Thank you for the food.
-No problem.

00:26:39.135 --> 00:26:40.570
Hatano, that thing.

00:26:41.337 --> 00:26:42.472
Right, I almost forgot.

00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:43.973
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.041
Good evening.

00:26:45.108 --> 00:26:46.710
Oh, good evening.

00:26:49.946 --> 00:26:51.181
What's the matter?

00:26:51.748 --> 00:26:53.049
I came to see someone.

00:26:53.883 --> 00:26:54.751
Who?

00:26:55.251 --> 00:26:57.187
Two men…

00:26:57.687 --> 00:26:59.322
They’re really…

00:26:59.823 --> 00:27:00.890
close, it seems.

00:27:03.226 --> 00:27:04.894
They’re in this apartment, yeah.

00:27:05.462 --> 00:27:07.564
-Want me to bring you to them?
-No, uh…

00:27:09.132 --> 00:27:10.333
They might not be the ones.

00:27:11.401 --> 00:27:12.235
What?

00:27:12.902 --> 00:27:16.039
Hotaru. Regarding the witnesses
for our marriage registration,

00:27:16.106 --> 00:27:18.908
one of them will be my mom…

00:27:18.975 --> 00:27:22.145
and I was hoping you could be the other.

00:27:24.881 --> 00:27:26.483
"Are you doing well?

00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:29.018
Over here, The Sequel:
Three Steps to a Happy Ending

00:27:29.085 --> 00:27:31.054
has started,

00:27:31.121 --> 00:27:33.523
and I can’t really die
even if I wanted to.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.192
In other words, I’m very well.

00:27:36.259 --> 00:27:37.694
Don’t worry.

00:27:37.761 --> 00:27:40.063
Well, worry a little, okay?

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.098
Anyway, congratulations on your marriage.

00:27:42.165 --> 00:27:44.033
By Mom."

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.968
Same as always.

00:27:45.034 --> 00:27:46.169
Seems like it.

00:27:48.371 --> 00:27:49.873
The witness section here.

00:27:49.939 --> 00:27:51.541
Can you please fill it out for us?

00:27:54.544 --> 00:27:55.411
This form…

00:27:55.478 --> 00:27:56.412
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM

00:27:56.479 --> 00:27:57.647
Are you really filing it?

00:27:58.148 --> 00:28:00.216
HUSBAND-TO-BE: SAKU SAKUTA

00:28:11.227 --> 00:28:14.297
HOTARU KUSUNOKI

00:28:15.298 --> 00:28:17.000
It's getting late. Want to stay over?

00:28:17.867 --> 00:28:19.002
Is that okay?

00:28:22.705 --> 00:28:25.308
The people you probably came to see

00:28:25.809 --> 00:28:27.043
are in that room over there.

00:28:31.047 --> 00:28:32.115
Tomorrow,

00:28:32.615 --> 00:28:34.317
if you feel like seeing them, you can.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.888
Sorry about this.

00:28:39.889 --> 00:28:42.725
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:28:44.661 --> 00:28:45.528
Yes?

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.131
Good morning.

00:28:48.198 --> 00:28:49.599
Good morning.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.235
You're from the guitar workshop…

00:28:52.735 --> 00:28:53.803
CHASU, CHAN

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:54.737
Um…

00:28:57.841 --> 00:28:58.675
This…

00:28:59.275 --> 00:29:00.410
hoodie.

00:29:01.678 --> 00:29:03.146
Are you two the ones wearing it?

00:29:04.714 --> 00:29:06.850
Yeah, that's us.

00:29:06.916 --> 00:29:07.917
Yup.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.554
Well, I think…

00:29:12.155 --> 00:29:13.156
I might…

00:29:17.293 --> 00:29:18.928
be gay too…

00:29:21.631 --> 00:29:24.734
We learned in class
that there are people like me,

00:29:28.538 --> 00:29:29.873
but around me,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.175
I don’t really see anyone like that.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:37.180
I haven’t been able
to talk to anyone about it.

00:29:46.422 --> 00:29:47.523
There’s someone…

00:29:48.024 --> 00:29:49.192
I like.

00:29:51.794 --> 00:29:52.629
But

00:29:52.695 --> 00:29:55.131
w-when I catch myself

00:29:55.198 --> 00:29:58.001
looking at them or thinking about them…

00:29:58.568 --> 00:30:01.804
It feels gross, scary, and I dislike it…

00:30:02.805 --> 00:30:04.440
The fact that I’m different from others

00:30:05.975 --> 00:30:07.143
is something I really hate.

00:30:08.912 --> 00:30:11.714
But then, while searching online,

00:30:11.781 --> 00:30:12.782
I came across this.

00:30:14.851 --> 00:30:15.685
And I realized…

00:30:15.752 --> 00:30:18.354
"Ah, I've already met them.

00:30:19.822 --> 00:30:21.257
Someone like me

00:30:21.758 --> 00:30:23.960
really does exist out there."

00:30:26.562 --> 00:30:27.864
When I thought about that…

00:30:28.831 --> 00:30:29.966
just a little,

00:30:30.566 --> 00:30:32.835
it made me feel better.

00:30:34.604 --> 00:30:37.473
I just wanted to say thank you for that.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.342
Really, thank you so much.

00:30:40.843 --> 00:30:41.911
I see.

00:30:44.414 --> 00:30:45.648
It must be hard on you.

00:30:46.883 --> 00:30:47.717
No…

00:30:50.386 --> 00:30:51.621
These tears are…

00:30:53.122 --> 00:30:55.458
both sad and happy tears.

00:30:56.192 --> 00:30:57.493
Half of each.

00:30:58.628 --> 00:30:59.662
What does that mean?

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.566
I’ve always wanted to talk to someone.

00:31:05.001 --> 00:31:06.803
It’s hard,

00:31:07.804 --> 00:31:09.739
but I’m happy too now, really.

00:31:11.641 --> 00:31:12.976
The person you like…

00:31:13.876 --> 00:31:15.178
What do you like about him?

00:31:15.878 --> 00:31:17.547
If you don’t mind, tell me.

00:31:19.515 --> 00:31:21.351
-What club is he in?
-The basketball club.

00:31:23.186 --> 00:31:24.020
Ah…

00:31:24.787 --> 00:31:27.924
Does she… know about your relationship?

00:31:27.991 --> 00:31:29.826
-You mean Hotaru?
-Yes.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.095
She knows. All too well.

00:31:33.262 --> 00:31:34.497
Right.

00:31:35.898 --> 00:31:36.966
Don't worry.

00:31:37.467 --> 00:31:39.135
We won’t tell her if you don't want it.

00:31:41.037 --> 00:31:42.372
Thank you for understanding.

00:31:43.306 --> 00:31:44.674
Okay then. See you.

00:31:48.311 --> 00:31:50.546
-Take care on your way out.
-Thanks.

00:31:55.685 --> 00:31:57.186
-Were you able to see them?
-Yes.

00:31:57.787 --> 00:31:59.055
That's good to hear.

00:31:59.122 --> 00:32:01.758
Can I visit you again?

00:32:01.824 --> 00:32:03.493
Of course!

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.696
I’m actually planning to travel soon.

00:32:06.763 --> 00:32:09.799
Then please come visit Nagano next time.

00:32:09.866 --> 00:32:11.934
Sounds good! I'll definitely go.

00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:14.570
Okay then. See you!

00:32:14.637 --> 00:32:15.772
See you.

00:32:16.472 --> 00:32:19.709
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

00:32:20.576 --> 00:32:21.978
See you!

00:32:25.081 --> 00:32:27.116
Was that a new resident?

00:32:27.183 --> 00:32:28.618
Oh, hello.

00:32:30.753 --> 00:32:33.489
You really are amazing, Ms. Inokashira.

00:32:33.556 --> 00:32:34.857
What, me?

00:32:34.924 --> 00:32:36.426
People from all walks of life,

00:32:36.492 --> 00:32:39.262
you're able to accept them wholeheartedly.
That's incredible.

00:32:39.829 --> 00:32:42.198
That’s my job as a landlady.

00:32:44.567 --> 00:32:45.568
Actually, I came today

00:32:46.069 --> 00:32:47.703
with a request.

00:32:49.038 --> 00:32:51.074
I want to live here.

00:32:51.674 --> 00:32:52.508
Really?

00:32:52.575 --> 00:32:55.545
I didn’t want to be looked down on.

00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:57.480
I wanted people to think I was cool.

00:32:57.547 --> 00:32:59.282
That’s why I was looking to buy a condo.

00:32:59.348 --> 00:33:01.150
I searched high and low,

00:33:01.784 --> 00:33:04.720
but I couldn’t decide on any of them.

00:33:05.221 --> 00:33:06.656
Is that so?

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.358
Every property I looked at,

00:33:09.425 --> 00:33:11.327
I could imagine myself living there.

00:33:11.828 --> 00:33:13.529
But every time
I looked at a different one,

00:33:13.596 --> 00:33:15.264
I no longer knew which version

00:33:15.331 --> 00:33:16.699
of myself I should choose.

00:33:18.701 --> 00:33:21.938
Did you imagine yourself living here too?

00:33:22.839 --> 00:33:23.840
Yes.

00:33:24.707 --> 00:33:25.741
And…

00:33:26.576 --> 00:33:29.645
that version of me
felt the most appropriate!

00:33:31.214 --> 00:33:32.415
I’ve made up my mind.

00:33:32.982 --> 00:33:34.617
My love and revolution…

00:33:35.118 --> 00:33:36.519
the person I am now…

00:33:37.019 --> 00:33:38.221
it all starts here!

00:33:38.721 --> 00:33:40.289
Please accept me.

00:33:40.356 --> 00:33:42.391
Of course, I'm more than happy
to welcome you.

00:33:42.458 --> 00:33:43.793
Thank you.

00:33:44.293 --> 00:33:45.962
Perfect timing, actually.

00:33:46.028 --> 00:33:48.331
Mind if I make a request myself too?

00:33:48.397 --> 00:33:49.232
What?

00:33:50.566 --> 00:33:52.969
The reception is over there, I guess.

00:33:53.035 --> 00:33:55.738
CITIZEN AFFAIRS SECTION

00:33:58.808 --> 00:34:01.177
Should we just come
another time after all?

00:34:01.244 --> 00:34:02.211
But…

00:34:02.979 --> 00:34:04.814
it’s not just our problem, right?

00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:06.782
Yeah.

00:34:08.184 --> 00:34:09.252
Let's go.

00:34:13.723 --> 00:34:14.891
Here you go.

May I please have your IDs?

00:34:25.234 --> 00:34:26.168
Okay.

00:34:28.437 --> 00:34:29.872
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.108
-Here.
-Thank you.

00:34:33.075 --> 00:34:34.076
Okay…

GENICHI HATANO, SAKU SAKUTA

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:38.781
Mr. Genichi Hatano…

00:34:39.849 --> 00:34:42.118
and Mr. Saku Sakuta.

00:34:44.086 --> 00:34:45.388
May I confirm you two…

00:34:46.055 --> 00:34:46.956
are male partners?

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.192
-Yes.
-That's right.

00:34:49.692 --> 00:34:52.595
Please allow me to seek advice.
I will get back to you shortly.

00:34:56.432 --> 00:34:57.900
Excuse me.

00:34:59.135 --> 00:35:00.169
Can you please…

00:35:05.741 --> 00:35:08.411
I’ll need to check with my superior,

00:35:08.477 --> 00:35:11.247
so please wait a little longer.
I apologize for the inconvenience.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.118
It’s taking a while, huh?

00:35:16.752 --> 00:35:17.954
Yeah.

00:35:20.323 --> 00:35:21.958
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:35:22.458 --> 00:35:23.426
This way, please.

00:35:23.492 --> 00:35:24.694
Okay.

00:35:27.697 --> 00:35:29.398
We’re very sorry,

00:35:30.032 --> 00:35:33.236
but we’re unable
to accept this marriage registration.

00:35:33.936 --> 00:35:36.639
Considering the both of you
came all the way together,

00:35:36.706 --> 00:35:38.374
we truly apologize for that.

00:35:39.375 --> 00:35:42.078
No, we should be the ones apologizing

00:35:42.144 --> 00:35:43.512
for taking your time.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.314
Thank you for your effort,

00:35:45.381 --> 00:35:47.083
-we’re sorry for the trouble.
-Not at all.

00:35:47.717 --> 00:35:48.584
But…

00:35:49.085 --> 00:35:51.320
the fact that you came today

00:35:52.188 --> 00:35:53.222
will be properly

00:35:53.856 --> 00:35:54.957
documented.

00:35:55.858 --> 00:35:58.661
We’ll ensure it’s reported.

00:36:00.129 --> 00:36:01.163
Thank you.

00:36:01.731 --> 00:36:03.065
Thank you.

00:36:04.567 --> 00:36:05.668
Oh and…

00:36:07.837 --> 00:36:11.007
minors cannot act as witnesses.

00:36:13.909 --> 00:36:16.178
It was a no-go after all.

00:36:16.912 --> 00:36:19.015
We even made a blunder to begin with.

00:36:22.285 --> 00:36:25.588
But they said they'll let
their people know about us.

00:36:26.489 --> 00:36:27.923
They'll make a report about it.

00:36:29.558 --> 00:36:31.861
Our efforts were not wasted, right?

00:36:36.399 --> 00:36:37.300
Yup.

00:36:39.268 --> 00:36:40.903
It was worth it.

00:36:42.605 --> 00:36:43.205
Look, I passed!

00:36:43.272 --> 00:36:44.006
PASSED

00:36:44.073 --> 00:36:46.208
-Congrats!
-Congrats!

00:36:46.275 --> 00:36:47.143
Also…

00:36:48.678 --> 00:36:49.712
What is it?

00:36:51.681 --> 00:36:52.515
This.

00:36:52.581 --> 00:36:53.249
ZENPUKUJI MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:36:53.316 --> 00:36:54.917
We got exposed after all,

00:36:57.253 --> 00:36:59.722
so it won’t be in the yearbook.

00:37:01.757 --> 00:37:03.192
Well, figured.

00:37:04.894 --> 00:37:06.329
But,

00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:07.963
it was such a great memory!

00:37:08.531 --> 00:37:09.565
It was super fun!

00:37:09.632 --> 00:37:11.867
I’m going to treasure this.

00:37:11.934 --> 00:37:13.102
Me too.

00:37:14.804 --> 00:37:15.805
I'll treasure it.

00:37:19.909 --> 00:37:21.310
Hotaru!

00:37:41.263 --> 00:37:43.032
Are you going on a trip?

00:37:43.099 --> 00:37:45.468
Yeah. I realized I could

00:37:45.534 --> 00:37:47.803
probably go anywhere,

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.673
so I want to see more of the world.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.007
Such as?

00:37:52.074 --> 00:37:53.843
For starters, maybe seagulls.

00:37:53.909 --> 00:37:55.578
All the different kinds of seagulls.

00:37:56.212 --> 00:37:57.046
Sounds good.

00:37:57.747 --> 00:37:59.949
Look after things until I get back.

00:38:00.015 --> 00:38:02.084
Be nice to my stand-in too, okay?

00:38:02.151 --> 00:38:04.286
-Who's that?
-What?

00:38:05.221 --> 00:38:06.856
Hey, can you sing for me?

00:38:07.423 --> 00:38:09.158
Huh? Sing?

00:38:09.225 --> 00:38:11.727
-But I thought you were drawing us?
-Just do it.

00:38:12.361 --> 00:38:13.229
Okay.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:17.700
Today’s place to sleep

00:38:17.767 --> 00:38:20.503
Is on a park bench

00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:23.005
Sleeping in cramped spots

00:38:23.072 --> 00:38:25.541
Is what you're used to

00:38:25.608 --> 00:38:26.675
Keep it coming!

00:38:27.176 --> 00:38:28.010
Okay.

00:38:28.511 --> 00:38:30.880
Tomorrow’s place

00:38:30.946 --> 00:38:33.582
Will be in a car

00:38:33.649 --> 00:38:35.985
Fallen leaves

00:38:36.051 --> 00:38:39.989
Will wrap you up

00:38:40.055 --> 00:38:41.056
Louder!

00:38:41.624 --> 00:38:44.460
No home, oh, n--

00:38:44.527 --> 00:38:47.296
-This has always bugged me, you know?
-What is it?

00:38:47.363 --> 00:38:48.864
You do have a home, no?

00:38:49.465 --> 00:38:50.533
Right here!

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.368
You're right.

00:38:52.435 --> 00:38:53.803
She's got a point.

00:38:54.303 --> 00:38:55.871
So change it.

00:38:57.072 --> 00:38:58.374
Ready, go!

00:38:58.441 --> 00:39:00.976
Home

00:39:01.043 --> 00:39:03.412
Oh, your sweet home

00:39:03.479 --> 00:39:06.182
All of Japan, no, the whole world
is all ears!

00:39:07.716 --> 00:39:10.319
Home

00:39:10.386 --> 00:39:12.621
Oh, your sweet home

00:39:12.688 --> 00:39:15.591
The vast sky

00:39:15.658 --> 00:39:17.426
Is your roof

00:39:17.493 --> 00:39:18.327
More!

00:39:18.394 --> 00:39:20.463
The day after tomorrow…

00:39:20.529 --> 00:39:23.165
The day after tomorrow…

00:39:23.232 --> 00:39:26.202
Let's go look for

00:39:26.268 --> 00:39:28.804
Your new home

00:39:28.871 --> 00:39:30.706
After the beep tone,

00:39:30.773 --> 00:39:33.642
please leave your name and message.

00:39:34.143 --> 00:39:35.978
Hello, Mr. Hatano?

00:39:36.045 --> 00:39:37.746
Things got hectic after that

00:39:37.813 --> 00:39:39.849
and we never really got to talk,

00:39:39.915 --> 00:39:41.183
so I thought I’d call.

00:39:41.851 --> 00:39:43.786
I’m doing my best over here.

00:39:44.353 --> 00:39:46.188
-I haven't skipped school either.
-Ah, Hotaru!

00:39:46.822 --> 00:39:49.425
Also, my mom calls me every day.

00:39:49.492 --> 00:39:50.326
It's a bit annoying.

00:39:52.094 --> 00:39:55.231
Her company forgave what she did,

00:39:55.297 --> 00:39:57.833
which allowed her
to be released from the police.

00:39:59.134 --> 00:40:00.669
-You know…
-Hey, Koharu!

00:40:00.736 --> 00:40:01.604
Let me see.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.639
…until my mom left home,

00:40:04.273 --> 00:40:06.709
-Be careful, okay?
-I thought places like Toyoko…

00:40:07.209 --> 00:40:08.077
There.

00:40:09.845 --> 00:40:10.779
How does it look?

00:40:13.716 --> 00:40:15.951
Looks… good!

00:40:16.018 --> 00:40:17.253
Good boy.

00:40:17.319 --> 00:40:19.255
…or my divorced dad…

00:40:19.321 --> 00:40:20.956
Good boy.

00:40:21.023 --> 00:40:22.925
or gay people…

00:40:22.992 --> 00:40:24.326
I've decided on this place.

00:40:24.827 --> 00:40:26.328
Very well.

00:40:26.395 --> 00:40:29.164
-Alright, please fill out this form…
-Mr. Okabe.

00:40:30.466 --> 00:40:33.869
Could you watch me while I take this off?

00:40:33.936 --> 00:40:34.803
Sure.

00:40:35.871 --> 00:40:38.374
I’m going to start afresh from here!

00:40:49.018 --> 00:40:50.085
Welcome!

00:40:50.586 --> 00:40:51.887
This is for me,

00:40:51.954 --> 00:40:53.589
the landlady's stand-in,

00:40:53.656 --> 00:40:56.191
and Mrs. Tomoe. I got dango for us.

00:40:56.258 --> 00:40:57.092
Really?

00:40:57.626 --> 00:40:59.261
Mrs. Tomoe!

00:40:59.328 --> 00:41:02.298
-We've got some dango!
-Coming!

00:41:02.364 --> 00:41:04.600
…or those news-type incidents…

00:41:09.171 --> 00:41:10.606
or even animals…

00:41:12.408 --> 00:41:15.711
I thought none of it had
anything to do with me.

00:41:16.211 --> 00:41:18.080
-Be careful not to collapse them.
-Okay.

00:41:18.147 --> 00:41:20.115
But I was wrong.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:22.952
Everything in this world

00:41:23.018 --> 00:41:25.588
might be connected to me
in some way, I thought.

00:41:28.157 --> 00:41:29.625
And if I keep thinking that way,

00:41:30.192 --> 00:41:32.428
maybe I can become a kinder person.

00:41:37.967 --> 00:41:41.203
There was something I meant
to give you and Mr. Sakuta.

00:41:42.037 --> 00:41:43.739
Has it arrived yet?

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.010
I just kept eating them
until I finally got a winning stick.

00:41:49.278 --> 00:41:51.880
It’s my own way of saying thank you
for everything.

00:41:53.148 --> 00:41:55.351
Really… thank you for all you did.

00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:57.886
Okay then. Talk to you again.

00:41:58.487 --> 00:41:59.788
Ah, there you are.

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.792
This spot is nice, isn't it?

00:42:04.326 --> 00:42:05.160
Yes.

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.265
You carry that around with you?

00:42:11.066 --> 00:42:13.669
Yes, as a charm. How about you, Sakuta?

00:42:14.703 --> 00:42:16.105
I’m afraid of losing it…

00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:19.908
so it's always in here.

00:42:20.409 --> 00:42:22.177
-I knew it.
-There you have it.

00:42:25.614 --> 00:42:26.749
Sakuta.

00:42:27.683 --> 00:42:28.917
What is it?

00:42:28.984 --> 00:42:31.353
Until we can actually file
the marriage registration…

00:42:32.254 --> 00:42:33.122
Let’s stay together.

00:42:33.188 --> 00:42:34.823
What’s that all of a sudden?

00:42:35.391 --> 00:42:38.060
Let’s be together forever
until we can buy a house.

00:42:40.763 --> 00:42:43.332
-Okay.
-Forever, and I mean it.

00:42:43.832 --> 00:42:44.667
Let's stay together.

00:42:45.601 --> 00:42:46.635
Yeah, okay.

00:42:47.136 --> 00:42:48.804
U-Um!

00:42:48.871 --> 00:42:51.106
Sorry to bother you while you’re busy…

00:42:52.241 --> 00:42:54.576
-Hm?
-The next pair for the viewing are here.

00:42:55.277 --> 00:42:56.345
Let's go.

00:42:56.412 --> 00:42:57.312
This way.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.782
Come on.

00:43:03.519 --> 00:43:06.088
WINNER

00:44:53.495 --> 00:44:55.998
