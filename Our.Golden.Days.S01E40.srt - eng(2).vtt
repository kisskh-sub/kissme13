WEBVTT

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:07.506
- What brings you here? - Don't we have the same mother?

00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:10.516
Ko Seong Hui.

00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:14.986
I heard you and Woo Jin are twins.

00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:19.226
So I guess that makes you my sister, too, right?

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:24.596
I overheard you at the hospital the other day.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:34.036
So why are you here?

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:37.676
I came here because I wanted to meet you.

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:38.946
No.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.916
- What? - You're that woman's daughter.

00:00:43.646 --> 00:00:44.846
And while you may be Woo Jin's...

00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:49.516
half-sister, you're no sister of mine.

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:52.986
I have my own family.

00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:55.456
After everything...

00:00:56.026 --> 00:00:58.226
your mother put me through,

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:01.966
I don't want anything to do with anyone connected to her.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.936
We're not supposed to be meeting like this.

00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:08.936
You keep saying "your mother,"

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:12.976
- but she's your mother too. - Did you not hear me?

00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:17.946
You.

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:21.146
Did your mother put you up to this?

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:24.256
No, absolutely not.

00:01:26.456 --> 00:01:27.556
Then leave.

00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:29.496
And don't come back.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.896
I didn't come here thinking...

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.506
I'd finally have a sister to vent to.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.066
It's just...

00:01:42.806 --> 00:01:45.076
I wanted to thank you for giving Woo Jin your liver.

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:48.006
And since you were born to a mother like ours,

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:49.716
I know you've been through so much.

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:54.886
I came because I wanted to apologise in her place.

00:01:56.756 --> 00:01:57.786
Why...

00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:00.486
are you the one apologising?

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:03.126
Is she really Ko Seong Hui's daughter?

00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:06.926
Or did Ko Seong Hui put her up to this?

00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:10.936
Because we both had to live with the same mother.

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.936
Our mom never apologised to you, did she?

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:20.706
I'm sure she didn't.

00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:25.646
I've never once heard her say she's sorry in my entire life.

00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:28.786
That's why...

00:02:29.556 --> 00:02:33.286
I really wanted to be the one to say it to you.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.766
Just because I found out about you,

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:42.366
I'm not going to tell our mom or my dad.

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.096
This is...

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:46.506
It's too big of a deal.

00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:49.506
My dad wouldn't be able to handle it.

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:52.106
Do whatever you want.

00:02:53.376 --> 00:02:54.806
I don't care either way.

00:02:56.716 --> 00:02:59.186
If you're done, you can leave now.

00:03:04.856 --> 00:03:06.126
Goodbye.

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:19.606
If I could treat you like a sister for a second...

00:03:20.036 --> 00:03:21.506
and ask you something, would that be okay?

00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:25.646
I want to be a webtoon artist.

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:28.006
And I just came up with a new idea I want to write about.

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:29.716
But...

00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:33.386
if it means going against my mom and dad,

00:03:34.746 --> 00:03:36.416
do you think I can do it?

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:39.786
That is unbelievably pathetic.

00:03:41.126 --> 00:03:42.196
Just go.

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:53.636
Of course, you should write it. Why wouldn't you?

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.606
If that's what you want to do, why wouldn't you do it?

00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:05.346
A good parent wouldn't stop you from doing that.

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:10.516
If parents truly love their child, they'll let them do what they want.

00:04:10.986 --> 00:04:12.826
It's the parent's job to lose that battle.

00:04:15.096 --> 00:04:17.596
How did you and Woo Jin grow up to be so clueless?

00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:24.896
You're both so good-looking on the outside, too.

00:04:26.136 --> 00:04:28.066
If you're going to ask such a pathetic question,

00:04:28.436 --> 00:04:29.636
don't ever come back.

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:32.246
So if I'm not being dumb, I can come back?

00:04:37.046 --> 00:04:38.046
No...

00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:43.216
Just don't.

00:04:47.156 --> 00:04:48.156
Okay.

00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:05.746
I don't think you have to worry about her.

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:08.816
Thankfully,

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:10.876
she's nothing like her mother.

00:05:14.716 --> 00:05:16.156
Okay, Woo Jin.

00:05:17.286 --> 00:05:18.486
I'll call you later.

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:19.986
Okay.

00:05:27.666 --> 00:05:29.336
Her whole life,

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:32.636
she's never heard her mother say sorry?

00:05:36.476 --> 00:05:37.536
Park Yeong Ra.

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:42.016
You poor thing.

00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:49.616
Gosh, what's taking her so long? I shouldn't have let her go alone.

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:53.256
Come on, Lee Ji Wan. Why are you ignoring your main duty?

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.096
This won't do. I have to call her.

00:05:57.496 --> 00:05:58.496
Ji Wan.

00:06:00.696 --> 00:06:01.866
I've made up my mind.

00:06:02.336 --> 00:06:03.336
About what?

00:06:03.736 --> 00:06:06.406
I'll reclaim the name, Freedom, and sign the contract myself.

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:11.206
Did you go ask your father for permission?

00:06:12.476 --> 00:06:13.476
Not exactly.

00:06:14.246 --> 00:06:16.876
Someone helped me resolve my last remaining doubt.

00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:19.686
And who was that?

00:06:20.946 --> 00:06:21.956
Just someone.

00:06:22.886 --> 00:06:26.186
I don't have to tell you every single thing, do I?

00:06:28.226 --> 00:06:30.296
You're right.

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.966
We're nothing to each other anyway.

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:40.506
Since we'll be total strangers once I quit,

00:06:41.306 --> 00:06:42.576
she's already putting up a wall.

00:06:44.236 --> 00:06:46.146
Ji Wan, I'm going to get to work.

00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:57.716
That webtoon you recommended. It's amazing.

00:06:57.716 --> 00:06:59.686
You have a real talent for making webtoons.

00:06:59.826 --> 00:07:01.356
There comes a time when you have to decide.

00:07:01.686 --> 00:07:02.696
And...

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:05.366
that's a decision only you can make.

00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:07.896
If that's what you want to do, why wouldn't you do it?

00:07:09.236 --> 00:07:13.006
A good parent wouldn't stop you from doing that.

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:17.136
If parents truly love their child, they'll let them do what they want.

00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:19.306
It's the parent's job to lose that battle.

00:07:20.476 --> 00:07:23.476
If your parents truly love you, they'll let you have your way.

00:07:34.426 --> 00:07:37.696
You can date him casually, but it can't go any further.

00:07:37.926 --> 00:07:40.226
I called you here to make that perfectly clear.

00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:42.596
The heir to a corporate group...

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:45.166
marries into a family that can be an asset to the company.

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:48.006
Why can't I stop crying?

00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:51.536
(Seong Jae)

00:07:56.046 --> 00:07:57.146
Hey, Seong Jae!

00:07:57.876 --> 00:07:58.886
Su Bin.

00:07:59.346 --> 00:08:01.116
What's wrong with your voice? Did you catch a cold?

00:08:01.746 --> 00:08:04.856
Oh, I think I caught a sore throat at the shoot yesterday.

00:08:05.656 --> 00:08:07.286
Seong Jae, how did your meeting go yesterday?

00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:09.856
You had an outdoor shoot? Where?

00:08:11.156 --> 00:08:12.626
Yes. In Jongno.

00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:15.896
You should've worn a warmer jacket.

00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:17.936
You went out without bundling up again, didn't you?

00:08:18.036 --> 00:08:21.566
No, I didn't. I wore my thick, cream-coloured coat.

00:08:22.406 --> 00:08:24.806
Really? What about medicine? Did you take any?

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:26.546
I'll pick some up and bring it over.

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:29.716
Seong Jae, my mom's calling for me. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

00:08:34.886 --> 00:08:36.356
Just because her mom calls,

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.316
she hangs up on me?

00:08:41.686 --> 00:08:43.496
Her voice also sounded like she'd been crying.

00:08:45.296 --> 00:08:46.766
Something's off with Su Bin.

00:08:47.926 --> 00:08:49.196
(Lee Su Bin)

00:08:51.366 --> 00:08:52.406
What?

00:08:53.736 --> 00:08:54.936
(Seong Jae, I'm busy. I'll call you tomorrow.)

00:08:55.006 --> 00:08:58.236
Seong Jae, I'm busy. I'll call you tomorrow.

00:09:02.516 --> 00:09:05.046
I wore my thick, cream-coloured coat.

00:09:11.316 --> 00:09:12.686
Around 2pm yesterday,

00:09:13.026 --> 00:09:15.726
was someone named Lee Su Bin on the visitor log?

00:09:19.296 --> 00:09:22.436
Yes, sir. She was here yesterday at 2pm.

00:09:26.206 --> 00:09:27.566
Was she here to see the Chairman?

00:09:34.646 --> 00:09:35.916
I'm at the park in front of your place.

00:09:36.316 --> 00:09:37.316
Come outside.

00:09:38.946 --> 00:09:39.946
What?

00:09:44.786 --> 00:09:47.426
Seong Jae, shouldn't you be at work? Why are you here all of a sudden?

00:09:51.096 --> 00:09:52.626
Why are your eyes so puffy?

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:56.866
- Have you been crying? - No. Maybe it's from lying down.

00:09:58.266 --> 00:10:00.136
Did you cry after meeting my father yesterday?

00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:03.236
Well...

00:10:09.146 --> 00:10:10.716
The Chairman must have told you.

00:10:11.946 --> 00:10:13.316
Isn't that Su Bin?

00:10:14.746 --> 00:10:17.386
And what's Seong Jae doing here at this hour?

00:10:18.616 --> 00:10:21.956
Why see my dad without telling me? What were you thinking?

00:10:24.996 --> 00:10:26.826
Did my father tell you not to say anything to me?

00:10:27.066 --> 00:10:30.766
- No, he didn't say that. - Then why didn't you tell me?

00:10:31.266 --> 00:10:33.336
You have no idea how ruthless my father is.

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:35.836
Why would you put yourself through that kind of humiliation?

00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:40.176
What did he say to you?

00:10:42.546 --> 00:10:43.646
That's...

00:10:43.646 --> 00:10:44.716
Did he tell you to break up with me?

00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:47.046
- That's not it. - Then what?

00:10:52.556 --> 00:10:53.586
Did he say we could only date?

00:10:57.296 --> 00:10:58.426
Su Bin.

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:01.166
You should have told me.

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:07.466
He called me secretly for a reason. That's why I went.

00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:09.776
Why would you make that call on your own?

00:11:10.476 --> 00:11:13.006
I could have handled everything. I was ready to.

00:11:14.046 --> 00:11:16.016
He must've said awful things to you. Really awful things.

00:11:17.846 --> 00:11:18.846
I'm sorry.

00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:20.846
For not telling you.

00:11:26.726 --> 00:11:27.726
No.

00:11:29.296 --> 00:11:30.296
I'm the one who's sorry.

00:11:31.056 --> 00:11:34.266
I won't let you be humiliated like that again.

00:11:37.636 --> 00:11:39.936
I'm sorry, Su Bin. I'm so sorry.

00:11:43.176 --> 00:11:44.576
What is all this?

00:11:48.976 --> 00:11:51.246
- Dad. - What are you two doing?

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:53.886
What was all that I just heard?

00:11:54.916 --> 00:11:56.656
Who was Su Bin called to see?

00:11:58.016 --> 00:11:59.056
That's...

00:12:00.556 --> 00:12:01.656
Dad, about that...

00:12:08.566 --> 00:12:09.596
Hey, Seong Jae.

00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:11.866
How could you do this?

00:12:12.506 --> 00:12:14.836
How dare you go after our Su Bin, you punk?

00:12:15.876 --> 00:12:17.036
What's going on?

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:21.676
I'm sorry, Father. Mother.

00:12:23.616 --> 00:12:25.316
Honey, what's wrong with them?

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:29.516
You see, they've been dating.

00:12:29.856 --> 00:12:33.056
They were secretly dating, the nerve of them!

00:12:33.186 --> 00:12:34.186
What?

00:12:37.426 --> 00:12:41.196
Hey, you brats. Kneeling won't do you any good.

00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:42.996
You two are over. As of right now.

00:12:43.536 --> 00:12:45.636
- Father. - Dad.

00:12:45.636 --> 00:12:49.676
Hey! Park Seong Jae! Lee Su Bin! What were you two thinking?

00:12:51.076 --> 00:12:54.606
- I'm sorry. - "Sorry" isn't enough. It's no use.

00:12:54.706 --> 00:12:57.216
There's getting stabbed in the back, and then there's this.

00:12:58.476 --> 00:12:59.486
Park Seong Jae.

00:13:00.316 --> 00:13:03.716
Not you. You, of all people, shouldn't have done this.

00:13:04.256 --> 00:13:06.826
The one person who knew better stabs us in the back?

00:13:07.586 --> 00:13:11.456
- Get out now. Out, right now! - Dad, please just listen to us.

00:13:11.526 --> 00:13:12.596
Su Bin, keep your mouth shut.

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:15.296
Get up, Seong Jae. Come on.

00:13:15.836 --> 00:13:16.836
Goodness.

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:19.506
Ji Hyuk, you knew about this?

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:22.806
My gosh, honey. It looks like Ji Hyuk knew.

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:25.906
- Oh, I feel dizzy. - Honey.

00:13:25.976 --> 00:13:27.706
- Mom! - Gosh, get away from me.

00:13:27.846 --> 00:13:29.476
Hurry, go inside. Go to your room. Go on.

00:13:29.546 --> 00:13:31.076
Come on, let's go, Seong Jae!

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:39.986
Hey, what's up with Seong Jae and Ji Hyuk?

00:13:40.256 --> 00:13:41.256
Did they have a fight?

00:13:45.926 --> 00:13:46.926
Hey!

00:13:47.466 --> 00:13:49.636
See? Why did you let it get to this point?

00:13:50.736 --> 00:13:51.736
I know.

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:59.976
- Let's go. Where did you park? - I'll go alone.

00:14:00.376 --> 00:14:01.376
Seong Jae.

00:14:03.446 --> 00:14:05.616
- I'll walk you to your car. - Ji Hyuk.

00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:08.786
I want to be alone.

00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:24.896
Honey, get up. Take this calming herbal pill.

00:14:25.166 --> 00:14:27.206
- Get up. Come on. - My gosh.

00:14:29.706 --> 00:14:30.706
Mom.

00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:33.606
Yes.

00:14:39.286 --> 00:14:41.046
Mom, are you okay?

00:14:42.616 --> 00:14:43.856
Are you out of your mind?

00:14:44.586 --> 00:14:47.026
How could you be dating Seong Jae of all people?

00:14:47.426 --> 00:14:49.896
What does it matter who he is? I like him.

00:14:51.326 --> 00:14:54.826
He's divorced. And there's a nine-year age gap!

00:14:54.966 --> 00:14:57.996
Mom, it's not like we're getting married.

00:14:58.066 --> 00:15:01.906
- Su Bin, go to your room. Now. - Let's go, Su Bin.

00:15:02.976 --> 00:15:04.006
Come on.

00:15:04.106 --> 00:15:06.376
I'm so shocked I'm speechless.

00:15:06.446 --> 00:15:08.506
How are you two even a thing?

00:15:09.046 --> 00:15:12.946
No way! I know his family. Don't even think about it!

00:15:13.346 --> 00:15:16.016
His family would never approve of you!

00:15:16.256 --> 00:15:18.186
Gosh, I can't believe Seong Jae! This is too much.

00:15:18.916 --> 00:15:20.286
Don't you talk badly about Seong Jae.

00:15:20.556 --> 00:15:21.626
How long have you two been together?

00:15:22.186 --> 00:15:24.196
Don't tell me you started seeing him when his family hired me.

00:15:24.896 --> 00:15:26.866
No, it hasn't been that long.

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:29.066
That's a relief then.

00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:31.436
It's a good thing you got caught before you got in too deep.

00:15:31.736 --> 00:15:33.066
Perfect time to break things off.

00:15:33.536 --> 00:15:34.606
Ji Wan, get out.

00:15:35.006 --> 00:15:36.006
Hey, Lee Su Bin.

00:15:38.436 --> 00:15:39.446
Su Bin.

00:15:39.746 --> 00:15:40.806
Ji Hyuk, you should leave too.

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:44.676
This is why I tried to stop you.

00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:47.116
It's over between you two.

00:15:47.986 --> 00:15:49.186
So get over him.

00:15:51.656 --> 00:15:54.026
And you? Can you just turn your feelings off?

00:15:55.656 --> 00:15:56.756
What's that supposed to mean?

00:15:57.156 --> 00:15:58.256
I don't know.

00:15:58.796 --> 00:16:00.526
I don't know how I'll feel.

00:16:01.066 --> 00:16:04.166
So don't talk like breaking up is a given.

00:16:04.936 --> 00:16:07.966
- And what if you don't break up? - Ji Hyuk, please.

00:16:08.336 --> 00:16:12.036
Please! Just leave me alone, please!

00:16:28.556 --> 00:16:29.556
I'm home.

00:16:40.706 --> 00:16:43.076
From the look on his face, they broke up.

00:16:44.776 --> 00:16:46.876
But I guess she really hasn't told him she met me.

00:16:50.016 --> 00:16:53.616
She takes a hint well, and she's tight-lipped.

00:16:56.956 --> 00:16:58.886
He was dating a decent kid, I suppose.

00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:27.486
Of all people, why Seong Jae?

00:17:28.246 --> 00:17:30.516
Enough. You're going to talk my ear off.

00:17:59.046 --> 00:18:00.386
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

00:18:00.686 --> 00:18:03.186
Are you saying you won't give up, or that you can't?

00:18:04.786 --> 00:18:06.426
- Both. - Come on, Seong Jae.

00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:07.486
Ji Hyuk.

00:18:09.996 --> 00:18:11.126
Isn't there some way?

00:18:11.326 --> 00:18:14.896
A few days ago, you yourself said you'd only see her for 100 days.

00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:17.066
I didn't know.

00:18:18.296 --> 00:18:20.236
I didn't know then, even when I told you.

00:18:21.036 --> 00:18:23.336
I didn't know even until the moment your dad caught us.

00:18:25.176 --> 00:18:26.946
But when I woke up this morning, I realised something.

00:18:29.946 --> 00:18:31.146
I can't live without Su Bin.

00:18:32.446 --> 00:18:35.716
- What's with you? What will you do? - I'm...

00:18:36.516 --> 00:18:37.786
going to leave my father's company.

00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:40.956
- What? - I'm striking out on my own.

00:18:41.926 --> 00:18:43.496
I can make a living as the CEO of Next Labs.

00:18:44.796 --> 00:18:45.796
Seong Jae.

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:47.966
Don't be emotional about this.

00:18:49.096 --> 00:18:50.236
It means I'm going to try.

00:18:51.166 --> 00:18:52.166
You never know.

00:18:52.736 --> 00:18:55.436
Maybe if they see how I feel, your parents...

00:18:56.736 --> 00:18:58.436
- might give us their blessing. - No.

00:18:59.306 --> 00:19:01.406
That just means you're going to keep tormenting my parents.

00:19:03.316 --> 00:19:04.346
Then what about you?

00:19:05.316 --> 00:19:08.086
If Eun Oh's mother were against it, would you give up? Could you?

00:19:08.086 --> 00:19:12.216
Seong Jae, my situation's different. You don't know what she means to me.

00:19:12.286 --> 00:19:13.486
Can you prove that?

00:19:15.056 --> 00:19:16.056
A person's heart...

00:19:16.796 --> 00:19:18.826
is something no one can see. It can only be felt.

00:19:19.766 --> 00:19:21.426
And I'm telling you this is how I feel.

00:19:22.296 --> 00:19:25.296
You have no right to say if my feelings are deep or not.

00:19:29.236 --> 00:19:30.536
Seong Jae.

00:19:30.976 --> 00:19:33.276
I'm not just becoming independent because of Su Bin.

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:35.446
This whole situation...

00:19:36.016 --> 00:19:38.146
has made me reevaluate my life.

00:19:41.286 --> 00:19:42.286
Are you serious?

00:19:50.396 --> 00:19:51.696
(Shoealls)

00:19:52.556 --> 00:19:54.596
I'm here to see Chairman Park Jin Seok.

00:19:55.166 --> 00:19:56.466
Do you have an appointment?

00:19:56.766 --> 00:19:58.666
Just tell him Lee Su Bin's father is here.

00:19:59.236 --> 00:20:00.866
(Shoealls)

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.436
What? The Vice President isn't in yet?

00:20:06.106 --> 00:20:07.546
That punk.

00:20:08.146 --> 00:20:10.316
Is he really making a fuss because I called over that girl?

00:20:10.846 --> 00:20:12.346
Unbelievable.

00:20:18.816 --> 00:20:22.556
Sir, there's a man at reception who says he's Lee Su Bin's father.

00:20:23.296 --> 00:20:25.056
He said you'd know who he is.

00:20:25.996 --> 00:20:27.426
Lee Su Bin's father?

00:20:30.166 --> 00:20:31.166
Send him up.

00:20:33.636 --> 00:20:35.236
The nerve of this guy.

00:20:36.036 --> 00:20:37.306
How dare he come here?

00:20:43.476 --> 00:20:45.646
You've clearly never worked in an office.

00:20:46.416 --> 00:20:49.216
I'm not the kind of person you can just meet without an appointment.

00:20:49.656 --> 00:20:54.156
Appointment or not, the least you can do for a guest is stand up.

00:20:54.856 --> 00:20:58.296
You summoned my daughter as Seong Jae's father.

00:20:58.456 --> 00:21:00.866
Likewise, I've come to see Seong Jae's father.

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:02.626
Not the Chairman of Shoe Joy.

00:21:06.636 --> 00:21:09.476
(Shoealls)

00:21:12.636 --> 00:21:15.606
- Have a seat. - I'm not here to sit.

00:21:17.716 --> 00:21:20.146
I imagine you told my daughter the same old story.

00:21:21.116 --> 00:21:23.486
So, let me be the first to say it. We reject Seong Jae.

00:21:24.416 --> 00:21:28.086
Don't get me wrong. I love Seong Jae like a son, but...

00:21:28.726 --> 00:21:31.226
he's nowhere near good enough for my daughter.

00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:36.336
I'll never give Su Bin away to a man from a dark and troubled home.

00:21:37.466 --> 00:21:40.766
Do you even hear the nonsense you're spewing?

00:21:40.836 --> 00:21:43.736
He's divorced, and he's nine years older than her.

00:21:43.806 --> 00:21:46.606
And Seong Jae is completely under his father's thumb, isn't he?

00:21:46.976 --> 00:21:49.176
- Just look at his first marriage. - Watch it!

00:21:49.676 --> 00:21:53.086
Even if he's the king of tycoons, the answer is no!

00:21:53.216 --> 00:21:56.956
- Did you just disrespect me? - You started it!

00:21:57.316 --> 00:22:01.186
If you understand me, you and your son better back off.

00:22:02.656 --> 00:22:04.256
What's so wrong with being divorced once?

00:22:04.826 --> 00:22:07.166
He's handsome, tall, and has a great character.

00:22:07.566 --> 00:22:09.996
And I'm going to make him president once he's married.

00:22:10.536 --> 00:22:13.066
So where do you get off saying that he's not good enough?

00:22:13.136 --> 00:22:14.766
I won't accept him!

00:22:15.266 --> 00:22:17.436
My family will never accept a man like that.

00:22:18.106 --> 00:22:21.606
So don't you ever think about summoning my daughter again.

00:22:21.706 --> 00:22:22.816
If you do it one more time...

00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:28.486
I've said my piece. I'm leaving.

00:22:32.516 --> 00:22:33.526
Why, that...

00:22:37.196 --> 00:22:39.766
He did that on purpose, making me stand here while he rambled.

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:51.576
That Park Jin Seok... I'm glad I saw that jerk for myself.

00:22:52.276 --> 00:22:55.446
What a hack, using intimidation with his position and bluster.

00:22:56.716 --> 00:22:58.546
Seong Jae is nothing like his father.

00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:04.486
For spring and summer festivals, instead of T-shirts or button-downs,

00:23:04.556 --> 00:23:06.956
try pairing a soft knit top with jeans.

00:23:07.026 --> 00:23:09.556
You can give off a really soft and cosy vibe.

00:23:10.726 --> 00:23:12.056
Back then,

00:23:13.126 --> 00:23:14.496
I couldn't have even dreamed of this.

00:23:16.736 --> 00:23:18.896
Don't we look pretty good together?

00:23:19.506 --> 00:23:20.536
Go out with me.

00:23:22.936 --> 00:23:27.246
I saw you as Ji Hyuk's snot-nosed, but kind of clever, little sister.

00:23:30.346 --> 00:23:31.746
Dreaming of a future together?

00:23:32.416 --> 00:23:33.516
I just can't help but picture it.

00:23:34.616 --> 00:23:37.786
I can't imagine my life without Eun Oh in it anymore.

00:23:40.326 --> 00:23:42.026
To be honest, me too.

00:23:42.586 --> 00:23:43.596
Ji Hyuk.

00:23:53.506 --> 00:23:56.706
But I feel that instead of running around job sites,

00:23:56.806 --> 00:23:59.646
your real talent lies in design.

00:24:04.946 --> 00:24:05.946
Yes.

00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:13.326
What is it?

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:17.726
AP's head of design... I'm going to go for it.

00:24:18.296 --> 00:24:19.356
So you've decided?

00:24:20.266 --> 00:24:24.466
- I can quit if it doesn't work out. - Right, that's true.

00:24:25.396 --> 00:24:26.566
Still...

00:24:27.866 --> 00:24:31.076
First, let's get your application paperwork filled out.

00:24:31.706 --> 00:24:34.006
There's still a process, even for a direct hire.

00:24:34.376 --> 00:24:37.316
You were pretty sure I'd say yes, weren't you?

00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:41.746
Why waste time on negative thoughts when you can just be hopeful?

00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:45.786
I guess I am quite the talent.

00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:53.826
Your salary is listed there. I decided on it with the HR team.

00:24:54.096 --> 00:24:57.136
We considered your time at Doogle and that this is a scout offer.

00:24:57.236 --> 00:24:59.136
It's the highest salary in the industry.

00:25:01.806 --> 00:25:05.806
I see the salary as recognition for my past work.

00:25:06.036 --> 00:25:07.306
I gratefully accept.

00:25:08.106 --> 00:25:09.106
All right then!

00:25:09.846 --> 00:25:10.846
Sign here.

00:25:16.086 --> 00:25:17.986
(Ji Eun Oh)

00:25:23.826 --> 00:25:25.926
As AP's new head of design,

00:25:26.726 --> 00:25:27.726
welcome aboard.

00:25:30.866 --> 00:25:32.136
I'll do my best.

00:25:40.406 --> 00:25:41.806
Here, you need to eat.

00:25:46.416 --> 00:25:49.516
Mom, you said you have a headache. Why are you just having porridge?

00:25:49.816 --> 00:25:51.286
You need to eat a proper meal.

00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:54.086
Your mom has a headache from indigestion.

00:25:57.356 --> 00:25:59.996
Stop hovering. You make me anxious. Sit down and say what you want.

00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:01.796
What?

00:26:02.426 --> 00:26:05.336
You're beating around the bush because you have something to say.

00:26:06.636 --> 00:26:07.806
Mom, Dad.

00:26:08.406 --> 00:26:10.076
Please, just hear me out.

00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:13.076
If you're going to talk nonsense, just go upstairs, okay?

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:16.976
Seong Jae and I aren't saying we're going to get married.

00:26:17.046 --> 00:26:18.916
So why are you so angry and against us?

00:26:18.976 --> 00:26:22.086
Why date Seong Jae if you can't even marry him?

00:26:22.616 --> 00:26:25.186
Who even dates with marriage in mind these days?

00:26:25.316 --> 00:26:27.656
People just date and break up. That's how it is.

00:26:28.126 --> 00:26:30.456
Do you know why people get married?

00:26:30.896 --> 00:26:34.466
They date, grow attached, and marry if they can't be apart.

00:26:35.366 --> 00:26:38.166
If you keep liking him, marriage will be on your mind.

00:26:38.596 --> 00:26:40.606
But that can't happen with Seong Jae.

00:26:42.736 --> 00:26:44.936
So can't we just not get married?

00:26:45.106 --> 00:26:49.106
See? You're making this so difficult because you don't want to break up.

00:26:50.046 --> 00:26:52.016
I can't stand looking at you. Go to your room!

00:26:53.786 --> 00:26:55.316
Su Bin, go to your room.

00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:05.556
Seong Jae, you're here.

00:27:10.836 --> 00:27:11.866
Have a seat.

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:15.836
I'm afraid we can't have dinner together.

00:27:22.546 --> 00:27:23.576
Father, Mother.

00:27:27.446 --> 00:27:28.816
Please, I'm begging you.

00:27:29.856 --> 00:27:32.616
You've got some nerve. What do you think you're doing?

00:27:33.286 --> 00:27:35.656
I met your father today. It's all settled.

00:27:37.126 --> 00:27:39.966
So don't waste any more energy on this.

00:27:40.026 --> 00:27:41.026
Just let it go.

00:27:41.566 --> 00:27:43.266
I can't do that, Father.

00:27:44.336 --> 00:27:45.666
I am so sorry.

00:27:47.366 --> 00:27:48.436
I'm really sorry.

00:27:53.206 --> 00:27:54.246
I...

00:27:55.706 --> 00:27:57.216
I can't give up on her.

00:28:02.716 --> 00:28:03.716
I...

00:28:05.086 --> 00:28:06.316
Su Bin...

00:28:07.356 --> 00:28:08.986
I will only love Su Bin,

00:28:09.556 --> 00:28:10.926
and I'll spend my life cherishing her.

00:28:11.526 --> 00:28:14.426
I know you're against this because I'm not good enough for her.

00:28:14.496 --> 00:28:17.366
I know that all too well. But Father, Mother...

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:22.736
It's killing me.

00:28:25.736 --> 00:28:27.246
Please, I'm begging you.

00:28:31.546 --> 00:28:32.846
Park Seong Jae.

00:28:33.516 --> 00:28:36.756
- What are you doing, punk? - Honey, wait a minute.

00:28:37.486 --> 00:28:39.086
I have something to say to Seong Jae.

00:28:43.826 --> 00:28:44.826
Seong Jae.

00:28:46.056 --> 00:28:47.326
I just...

00:28:49.566 --> 00:28:51.536
You know how bright and cheerful our Su Bin is.

00:28:53.306 --> 00:28:55.136
She's cheerful and resilient,

00:28:56.106 --> 00:28:57.936
and yet she's so sensitive.

00:28:58.736 --> 00:29:00.676
And so thoughtful. That's my girl.

00:29:03.546 --> 00:29:04.876
I know, Mother.

00:29:05.876 --> 00:29:07.586
She's way too good for me...

00:29:09.246 --> 00:29:11.116
That's why I want Su Bin...

00:29:12.316 --> 00:29:14.186
to live life freely and spread her wings.

00:29:15.656 --> 00:29:17.696
I want that for her even after she's married.

00:29:20.396 --> 00:29:22.996
When Su Bin spreads her arms out wide,

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:27.406
I want her to be with someone who won't hold her back.

00:29:29.266 --> 00:29:30.376
I want her to fall in love with,

00:29:31.176 --> 00:29:33.276
date, and even marry someone like that.

00:29:37.416 --> 00:29:38.416
Seong Jae.

00:29:40.316 --> 00:29:42.246
Can you please do this one thing for me?

00:29:43.556 --> 00:29:45.956
Can't you let my Su Bin live a life like that?

00:29:49.726 --> 00:29:51.356
Please, do it for my sake, Seong Jae.

00:29:52.896 --> 00:29:54.626
You have to be the one to save me.

00:29:57.166 --> 00:29:58.496
Your family...

00:29:59.336 --> 00:30:01.306
If they don't approve of a daughter-in-law,

00:30:02.406 --> 00:30:05.006
they'll force a divorce, even after the wedding.

00:30:07.276 --> 00:30:11.016
Knowing that, how can I let my daughter marry you?

00:30:14.716 --> 00:30:17.486
Mother, I can be independent from my family.

00:30:18.056 --> 00:30:19.356
I will. I'll move out on my own.

00:30:24.456 --> 00:30:26.196
I know how kind,

00:30:26.896 --> 00:30:28.496
thoughtful, and warmhearted you are.

00:30:29.496 --> 00:30:32.236
I know. I know it all too well.

00:30:33.766 --> 00:30:35.866
But you're still the eldest son of that family.

00:30:37.306 --> 00:30:39.206
Moving out won't solve everything.

00:30:42.906 --> 00:30:44.976
I've heard and seen things, you know.

00:30:46.346 --> 00:30:49.616
You want Su Bin to be happy too, don't you?

00:30:52.556 --> 00:30:55.826
I'm so sorry, Seong Jae. I really am.

00:30:56.926 --> 00:30:58.426
For having to say this to you.

00:32:12.336 --> 00:32:16.406
What? Her father came by and said he's against Seong Jae?

00:32:16.706 --> 00:32:17.706
Why?

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:21.246
He brought up the divorce and said he doesn't want him.

00:32:21.576 --> 00:32:22.676
The nerve.

00:32:23.306 --> 00:32:26.676
He was just trying to save face since he knew it was a lost cause.

00:32:27.986 --> 00:32:29.446
For him to come all the way to see you...

00:32:29.816 --> 00:32:32.116
Gosh, that's so crude and intimidating.

00:32:33.526 --> 00:32:35.086
The girl seemed decent enough.

00:32:35.626 --> 00:32:38.926
I feared Seong Jae would get serious and ask to marry her.

00:32:39.896 --> 00:32:42.066
But her father came and neatly solved the problem.

00:32:43.666 --> 00:32:46.766
Goodness. That must have been so unpleasant for you.

00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:49.706
It takes all kinds.

00:33:01.416 --> 00:33:02.416
You...

00:33:03.386 --> 00:33:05.016
Don't you have anything to say to me?

00:33:06.986 --> 00:33:07.986
No, I don't.

00:33:08.426 --> 00:33:09.426
What do you mean you don't?

00:33:10.256 --> 00:33:12.096
You must have heard something from your girlfriend, right?

00:33:13.696 --> 00:33:15.266
Her family won't approve of me,

00:33:17.496 --> 00:33:18.496
so we broke up.

00:33:25.276 --> 00:33:26.846
So they really did object?

00:33:29.476 --> 00:33:30.646
That's ridiculous.

00:33:35.416 --> 00:33:36.416
Good.

00:33:36.956 --> 00:33:37.956
They broke up.

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:40.056
It's really and truly over.

00:33:41.856 --> 00:33:43.496
Woo Jin's situation is resolved.

00:33:45.026 --> 00:33:46.256
Now, all that's left is Yeong Ra.

00:34:06.746 --> 00:34:07.846
Hey, Seong Jae.

00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:09.886
You'll be home, right?

00:34:10.386 --> 00:34:11.986
I'll come pick you up by 6:30pm.

00:34:13.016 --> 00:34:17.026
Don't. Meet me at 11:50pm at the park in my neighbourhood.

00:34:18.126 --> 00:34:19.356
Did you say 11:50pm?

00:34:20.666 --> 00:34:22.666
But I already made a reservation at a hotel restaurant.

00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:25.466
Why would we have dinner together?

00:34:26.566 --> 00:34:30.176
I don't want Christmas Eve memories with you.

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:36.106
Let's just meet at 11:50pm.

00:34:39.346 --> 00:34:41.346
Okay. Fine.

00:34:52.526 --> 00:34:53.526
Ji Wan.

00:34:53.996 --> 00:34:55.066
Yes?

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:56.936
Are you mad at me about something?

00:34:57.836 --> 00:34:58.836
No.

00:35:00.136 --> 00:35:01.466
But you seem mad.

00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:04.206
You haven't said a word all morning.

00:35:05.906 --> 00:35:07.346
You're sore about what I said, aren't you?

00:35:08.446 --> 00:35:11.316
Hey. Still, you should at least tell me who you're meeting.

00:35:11.446 --> 00:35:14.246
This is a serious breach of my security duty.

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:16.846
I told you. I don't want to talk about it yet.

00:35:17.456 --> 00:35:18.586
I'll get back on my own, too.

00:35:20.626 --> 00:35:22.286
You've been moping around since that day, haven't you?

00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:26.226
It's just that you tell me everything else,

00:35:26.596 --> 00:35:28.496
so it makes me curious when you're suddenly so secretive.

00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:34.406
That my mom is someone who'd take her daughter's liver...

00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:36.536
I just don't want to have to tell you that.

00:35:39.676 --> 00:35:41.176
Why do you have to know everything?

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:44.476
- Who do you think you are? - We kissed, remember?

00:35:45.676 --> 00:35:47.716
- You said it was a mistake. - Whatever!

00:35:47.786 --> 00:35:49.046
Just get the car keys.

00:35:58.556 --> 00:35:59.556
Hey.

00:36:01.026 --> 00:36:03.996
I'm about to go tell my dad that I'm becoming a webtoon artist.

00:36:05.136 --> 00:36:08.366
So instead of being upset with me, you should be encouraging me.

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:13.336
Really?

00:36:14.706 --> 00:36:16.076
Right.

00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:22.246
I'm sorry, Yeong Ra.

00:36:23.686 --> 00:36:24.686
Encouragement.

00:36:30.656 --> 00:36:32.056
Park Yeong Ra, you're...

00:36:33.256 --> 00:36:35.466
You're a lot stronger than you think.

00:36:35.796 --> 00:36:37.436
You can do anything you set your mind to.

00:36:37.736 --> 00:36:40.436
And you're an amazing webtoon artist.

00:36:42.606 --> 00:36:43.606
And...

00:36:44.606 --> 00:36:47.746
if you could just see the look on your face when you draw,

00:36:48.646 --> 00:36:50.876
you'd fall for yourself too.

00:36:53.546 --> 00:36:54.946
Take a picture for me next time, without me knowing.

00:36:56.386 --> 00:36:57.386
Okay.

00:36:57.786 --> 00:37:01.086
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:37:01.156 --> 00:37:03.126
(Asking price: 2.5 million dollars)

00:37:03.186 --> 00:37:04.196
(Property information)

00:37:07.566 --> 00:37:08.566
And if I say no?

00:37:09.926 --> 00:37:10.936
Then I'll submit my resignation.

00:37:11.266 --> 00:37:13.036
In other words, I'll leave your company.

00:37:17.336 --> 00:37:19.576
Have the Sales Team for Japan come in.

00:37:19.836 --> 00:37:22.806
Tell the Management Team to compile and submit for my approval...

00:37:22.806 --> 00:37:24.476
all documents, including contracts related to the new product...

00:37:24.846 --> 00:37:28.086
and all companies we have verbal agreements with.

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:33.386
My goodness.

00:37:34.256 --> 00:37:36.056
Is this a surprise Christmas present?

00:37:36.956 --> 00:37:40.126
My daughter showing up on Christmas Eve is gift enough.

00:37:40.196 --> 00:37:41.526
(Shoealls)

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:43.736
Dad, you've never gotten a bouquet from a woman, have you?

00:37:45.466 --> 00:37:46.636
What to say?

00:37:47.306 --> 00:37:48.336
I actually have.

00:37:49.466 --> 00:37:50.476
From Mom?

00:37:51.636 --> 00:37:53.976
Besides your mom, what other woman is that classy?

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:57.676
Wait, there is someone else. My daughter.

00:37:59.376 --> 00:38:01.446
You take after your mom, of course.

00:38:02.686 --> 00:38:04.686
I don't think I'm that much like Mom.

00:38:04.816 --> 00:38:08.886
Well, you've got a long way to go to be like her.

00:38:13.726 --> 00:38:17.036
- Dad, I have something to tell you. - Yes?

00:38:17.096 --> 00:38:18.996
Dad, you know what a webtoon is, right?

00:38:19.396 --> 00:38:20.566
Well, I draw them.

00:38:21.166 --> 00:38:23.876
You draw comics? Is that your hobby?

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:26.736
No, it's not a hobby.

00:38:27.036 --> 00:38:29.606
I want to be a full-time artist. A webtoon artist.

00:38:30.646 --> 00:38:31.646
What?

00:38:32.716 --> 00:38:34.116
What? You're doing what?

00:38:35.116 --> 00:38:36.116
Like comics?

00:38:36.846 --> 00:38:37.856
Yes.

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:42.226
I've always loved both reading and drawing them.

00:38:42.886 --> 00:38:44.396
And now, I know for sure.

00:38:45.026 --> 00:38:47.826
I want to live my life as a webtoon artist.

00:38:49.466 --> 00:38:51.736
What childish nonsense are you spouting?

00:38:52.866 --> 00:38:53.936
Have you forgotten who you are?

00:38:54.706 --> 00:38:56.366
I've never heard of a business person...

00:38:56.366 --> 00:38:57.936
whose child draws comics.

00:38:59.376 --> 00:39:00.506
Don't you ever say that again.

00:39:04.246 --> 00:39:07.786
Your mother is trying to arrange the best possible marriage for you.

00:39:07.786 --> 00:39:10.046
She worked hard to make you a painter and now this?

00:39:10.686 --> 00:39:12.586
How dare you do something so beneath you?

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:19.856
But it's something I truly love, enjoy, and am good at.

00:39:20.896 --> 00:39:23.196
Can't you just let me do it and cheer me on?

00:39:25.366 --> 00:39:26.566
Does your mother know about this?

00:39:27.636 --> 00:39:29.266
She knew and let you get like this?

00:39:30.936 --> 00:39:33.946
Stop trying to disgrace our family and get a grip!

00:39:34.776 --> 00:39:35.776
I absolutely won't allow it!

00:39:37.676 --> 00:39:38.846
But Dad...

00:39:39.746 --> 00:39:41.546
I want to do it so badly.

00:39:42.416 --> 00:39:44.656
No! End of discussion!

00:39:59.166 --> 00:40:00.166
No.

00:40:01.306 --> 00:40:03.606
Unbelievable. What happened to this room?

00:40:09.646 --> 00:40:12.846
How could you discharge Woo Jin without my permission?

00:40:13.246 --> 00:40:17.886
He's an adult and was cleared to go, so the doctor approved it.

00:40:18.056 --> 00:40:20.956
But he can't fly for three months. That's why he was staying here.

00:40:21.126 --> 00:40:22.156
And you just let a sick kid walk out?

00:40:22.656 --> 00:40:26.326
He said he'll go to Dongwoo Hospital in Busan for outpatient care.

00:40:26.656 --> 00:40:27.796
Dongwoo Hospital in Busan?

00:40:30.566 --> 00:40:31.566
Ji Eun Oh...

00:40:33.496 --> 00:40:35.066
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

00:40:39.406 --> 00:40:40.406
Hello?

00:40:40.776 --> 00:40:42.246
Where did you hide Woo Jin?

00:40:43.976 --> 00:40:45.146
Hide him? What do you mean?

00:40:46.276 --> 00:40:47.586
Is Woo Jin missing?

00:40:47.886 --> 00:40:49.586
Stop playing games and just tell me.

00:40:50.046 --> 00:40:52.886
What can he possibly do in Korea on his own with no money?

00:40:53.056 --> 00:40:54.286
It doesn't make any sense.

00:40:54.626 --> 00:40:57.086
You're right. He wouldn't have any money.

00:40:58.826 --> 00:41:00.766
So he disappeared from the hospital?

00:41:02.426 --> 00:41:03.426
You really have no idea?

00:41:04.236 --> 00:41:05.596
I heard you've been visiting him twice a week.

00:41:07.706 --> 00:41:09.436
He didn't say anything to me about it.

00:41:10.006 --> 00:41:11.876
I'll start by calling his friends.

00:41:17.346 --> 00:41:19.116
So he disappeared without Eun Oh knowing?

00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:23.646
Then...

00:41:24.286 --> 00:41:27.556
(Mom)

00:41:37.666 --> 00:41:40.236
- Hello? - You've heard from Woo Jin, right?

00:41:41.336 --> 00:41:44.106
What makes you think Woo Jin would've contacted me?

00:41:44.406 --> 00:41:47.076
Because he left the hospital and disappeared.

00:41:49.646 --> 00:41:53.516
Did he? I haven't heard from him. I'm hanging up.

00:41:56.786 --> 00:41:59.916
My gosh. Her own brother's gone missing...

00:42:03.556 --> 00:42:04.726
Hey, Yeong Ra.

00:42:06.626 --> 00:42:08.296
What's this about Woo Jin disappearing?

00:42:10.126 --> 00:42:12.636
I think Woo Jin has made his decision.

00:42:13.166 --> 00:42:15.436
At some point, there are choices to be made.

00:42:16.106 --> 00:42:17.476
There comes a time when you have to decide.

00:42:19.506 --> 00:42:20.976
So that's what he meant.

00:42:22.646 --> 00:42:24.846
Woo Jin decided to strike out on his own.

00:42:25.976 --> 00:42:28.616
So what are you going to do?

00:42:29.486 --> 00:42:30.486
You mean about my dad?

00:42:31.656 --> 00:42:32.656
I'm moving on to the next step.

00:42:33.556 --> 00:42:35.856
And what is that supposed to mean?

00:42:38.396 --> 00:42:39.396
You're going to be surprised.

00:42:39.956 --> 00:42:42.496
The suspense is killing me. Just tell me!

00:42:44.696 --> 00:42:45.696
It's...

00:43:00.276 --> 00:43:02.746
Why haven't I heard from Ji Eun Oh?

00:43:06.316 --> 00:43:07.486
You still haven't found out?

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:11.526
(Eunoism, Ji Eun Oh)

00:43:12.096 --> 00:43:13.856
Gosh, why isn't she reading my texts?

00:43:16.796 --> 00:43:19.796
I'm leaving work now. Come straight home.

00:43:20.836 --> 00:43:21.836
What...

00:43:23.436 --> 00:43:24.436
My gosh.

00:43:25.006 --> 00:43:26.806
He sounded furious.

00:43:30.276 --> 00:43:31.716
I wonder if Woo Jin went home.

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:41.056
How exactly have you been handling Yeong Ra?

00:43:41.586 --> 00:43:43.426
Yeong Ra?

00:43:43.986 --> 00:43:46.096
What's this nonsense about her becoming a webtoon artist?

00:43:46.596 --> 00:43:49.596
She wants to waste her life on that. What have you been doing?

00:43:50.396 --> 00:43:51.396
Wait, Yeong Ra...

00:43:52.066 --> 00:43:55.436
Did Yeong Ra go see you at the office?

00:43:57.166 --> 00:43:58.176
Is something wrong with you?

00:43:59.306 --> 00:44:00.306
Why are you so distracted?

00:44:00.976 --> 00:44:02.546
You're clearly not listening to what I'm saying.

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:05.646
No, it's not that. The moment I heard Yeong Ra's name,

00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:07.686
I was just completely flustered.

00:44:07.986 --> 00:44:12.686
How could she think of going to you? I specifically told her not to.

00:44:13.686 --> 00:44:15.786
Why didn't you tell me about this sooner?

00:44:16.356 --> 00:44:19.556
Come on! Because it wasn't worth bothering you with.

00:44:20.326 --> 00:44:21.966
Here, just... Have a seat.

00:44:23.326 --> 00:44:24.336
Sit down.

00:44:25.036 --> 00:44:26.966
You've never had that kind of experience, right?

00:44:28.036 --> 00:44:30.006
Being around someone from a lower class,

00:44:30.006 --> 00:44:31.876
I thought she was just hooked on that cheap drama like junk food,

00:44:31.876 --> 00:44:33.236
and that it would pass.

00:44:33.606 --> 00:44:35.806
Besides, that boy is Seong Jae's friend's brother.

00:44:36.646 --> 00:44:38.576
So you're saying Mr. Lee influenced her?

00:44:39.046 --> 00:44:43.316
Of course. But I heard he resigned.

00:44:43.716 --> 00:44:45.556
So I figured my worries were over.

00:44:46.286 --> 00:44:49.056
But then, Yeong Ra came to see me all on her own.

00:44:49.786 --> 00:44:51.326
From tomorrow on, Yeong Ra is grounded.

00:44:54.866 --> 00:44:56.496
About Woo Jin getting a liver transplant,

00:44:57.366 --> 00:44:58.566
is it okay if I tell Dad?

00:45:00.366 --> 00:45:01.836
Well, honey.

00:45:02.306 --> 00:45:05.536
I think I was too overprotective, raising Yeong Ra in a bubble.

00:45:05.976 --> 00:45:08.646
So let's just think of this as a late rebellious phase.

00:45:08.946 --> 00:45:11.116
Honey, let's just cut her some slack.

00:45:12.216 --> 00:45:14.846
You have to nip these problems in the bud.

00:45:15.586 --> 00:45:19.856
It's just a late rebellious phase. You know how intense that can be.

00:45:20.986 --> 00:45:25.426
Once Mr. Lee is gone, she'll lose interest in no time.

00:45:25.696 --> 00:45:28.226
What can she do on her own? Where's the fun in doing it alone?

00:45:30.096 --> 00:45:32.666
And what if she still wants to do it even after he leaves?

00:45:33.236 --> 00:45:36.206
Well, in that case... Then we'll have to lock her up.

00:45:52.186 --> 00:45:54.886
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:45:54.956 --> 00:45:56.186
Merry Christmas.

00:46:00.256 --> 00:46:01.266
Here you go.

00:46:03.566 --> 00:46:06.366
What's this? Is it for my sister?

00:46:07.096 --> 00:46:08.106
Your sister? Who's that?

00:46:08.736 --> 00:46:12.576
Let's just call it a Christmas gift from a regular.

00:46:13.136 --> 00:46:14.136
Oh, my.

00:46:15.206 --> 00:46:17.446
- Mr. CEO, you're here. - Hello, Mother.

00:46:17.916 --> 00:46:20.616
And please, don't call me CEO. I'm one of Eun Oh's friends.

00:46:23.516 --> 00:46:26.856
And this is just a little something for Christmas Eve.

00:46:26.856 --> 00:46:29.026
You shouldn't have.

00:46:29.956 --> 00:46:31.656
All right, I'll be off then.

00:46:31.926 --> 00:46:35.696
Mr. Lee, I'm starving. Should we grab a bite before we go?

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:38.836
- Should we? - Of course. Please eat first.

00:46:39.966 --> 00:46:41.866
- Yes. - Gang Oh, give me a hand here.

00:46:49.176 --> 00:46:51.316
Gray tiles for the floor.

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:54.416
Natural wood for the walls.

00:46:55.616 --> 00:46:56.616
For the kitchen...

00:46:57.316 --> 00:46:59.616
Bronze metal accents would look nice.

00:47:02.226 --> 00:47:05.396
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:10.826
Is he a part-timer?

00:47:21.046 --> 00:47:22.046
Ji Hyuk?

00:47:23.776 --> 00:47:26.946
- Eun Oh. - What? What are you doing here?

00:47:27.346 --> 00:47:29.916
A bunch of customers left all at once.

00:47:35.326 --> 00:47:38.556
Ji Gang Oh, why accept help from just anyone?

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:41.766
Come on. Is he "just anyone" to you?

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:44.636
I thought he was more than just some guy.

00:47:46.336 --> 00:47:50.566
So if he's just some guy, should I kick him out next time?

00:47:51.376 --> 00:47:53.536
No, that's not what I meant.

00:47:54.276 --> 00:47:57.106
- Accepting his help makes me... - You don't like it?

00:47:57.606 --> 00:47:59.146
Or does it make you uncomfortable?

00:48:00.776 --> 00:48:02.486
Right. It's just...

00:48:03.016 --> 00:48:05.386
So which is it? You don't like it? Or it makes you uncomfortable?

00:48:06.256 --> 00:48:08.156
Why is the brilliant Ji Eun Oh suddenly so evasive?

00:48:09.126 --> 00:48:10.226
I'm uncomfortable.

00:48:10.526 --> 00:48:12.456
So don't ask him to help out anymore.

00:48:13.556 --> 00:48:16.366
So I can come as a customer daily, right?

00:48:18.196 --> 00:48:19.396
Yes, I guess.

00:48:19.766 --> 00:48:23.306
No. It's just that we can't really turn customers away.

00:48:23.366 --> 00:48:24.806
Eun Oh, you're beating around the bush.

00:48:25.876 --> 00:48:28.076
A simple "thank you" would've been enough.

00:48:29.476 --> 00:48:30.476
Thank you.

00:48:31.346 --> 00:48:32.776
Anyway, Merry Christmas.

00:48:33.516 --> 00:48:36.446
- I should get going now, Mother. - Oh, wait.

00:48:36.446 --> 00:48:37.546
Mr. Lee.

00:48:38.416 --> 00:48:39.516
Just a second.

00:48:41.356 --> 00:48:45.896
We always have cake on Christmas Eve.

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:47.796
Please stay and have some with us.

00:48:48.596 --> 00:48:49.596
Could I?

00:48:49.896 --> 00:48:52.636
To be honest, clearing those tables worked up an appetite.

00:49:03.476 --> 00:49:06.276
He helped us out. Our guest should eat first.

00:49:07.316 --> 00:49:08.486
Thank you, Mother.

00:49:08.916 --> 00:49:11.856
"Mother." That sounds a bit awkward.

00:49:13.516 --> 00:49:17.856
- Gang Oh. - Now, I'm curious.

00:49:18.426 --> 00:49:20.926
You and Eun Oh aren't dating, are you?

00:49:21.896 --> 00:49:23.996
- I'd like to be. - Ji Hyuk!

00:49:26.636 --> 00:49:28.206
My feelings are one-sided.

00:49:28.906 --> 00:49:29.936
I'm sorry.

00:49:30.406 --> 00:49:34.746
No, there's no need to apologise for your feelings.

00:49:35.346 --> 00:49:36.406
No, there is.

00:49:37.646 --> 00:49:38.646
It's just...

00:49:39.446 --> 00:49:40.676
I'm not good enough for her.

00:49:42.216 --> 00:49:43.946
That's enough. Let's just have some cake.

00:49:44.316 --> 00:49:45.516
- You too, Mom. - Right.

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.926
- After you, Mother. - All right.

00:49:48.526 --> 00:49:49.956
- Here, you have some. - Okay.

00:49:56.666 --> 00:49:59.466
This cake is delicious. Eun Oh has great taste.

00:50:02.536 --> 00:50:03.806
Let me do it. Give it here.

00:50:05.176 --> 00:50:06.336
Unbelievable.

00:51:06.696 --> 00:51:08.466
He should walk with his shoulders back.

00:51:20.576 --> 00:51:21.686
Seong Jae.

00:51:28.926 --> 00:51:30.086
Park Seong Jae.

00:51:36.326 --> 00:51:37.426
You're asking for trouble.

00:51:37.936 --> 00:51:39.266
Who said you could call me Park Seong Jae?

00:51:39.736 --> 00:51:41.306
I've never had the chance to say it.

00:51:47.636 --> 00:51:48.746
You're not wearing gloves?

00:51:49.476 --> 00:51:50.476
Hold on.

00:51:58.586 --> 00:51:59.956
Merry Christmas.

00:52:02.456 --> 00:52:03.726
A Christmas present?

00:52:04.126 --> 00:52:06.756
Yes. I got mine early, remember?

00:52:13.336 --> 00:52:15.366
There was so much I wanted to give you.

00:52:16.836 --> 00:52:18.536
So many things I wanted to do for you.

00:52:19.476 --> 00:52:21.746
There were a lot of things I wanted to do with you, too.

00:52:23.776 --> 00:52:24.776
We really...

00:52:25.916 --> 00:52:27.746
missed out on a lot, didn't we?

00:52:28.746 --> 00:52:30.516
But there were so many good times, too.

00:52:31.456 --> 00:52:32.456
Let me see.

00:52:34.486 --> 00:52:35.626
You've got a cut.

00:52:37.686 --> 00:52:39.526
- Hey, you! - That day, I thought it was cool...

00:52:39.526 --> 00:52:42.696
- You're just going to take that? - how you got mad for me.

00:52:43.266 --> 00:52:45.536
- Because of my situation, - I didn't buy this...

00:52:45.536 --> 00:52:47.166
you put up with it and let her hit you.

00:52:47.166 --> 00:52:48.706
- That made me emotional. - Isn't it cute?

00:52:49.536 --> 00:52:51.236
- You were quirky and unpredictable. - You guessed it.

00:52:51.576 --> 00:52:53.876
- So it was fun. - Our date today is a camping trip.

00:52:54.076 --> 00:52:56.276
You were always so gentle,

00:52:57.146 --> 00:52:58.346
but when it counted,

00:52:58.946 --> 00:53:02.046
- you'd be tough, and I loved that. - Don't you yell at Su Bin.

00:53:02.386 --> 00:53:03.716
- That's what I loved about it. - Take it out on me.

00:53:04.986 --> 00:53:07.456
You always had some new expression I'd never seen before.

00:53:08.656 --> 00:53:10.356
- Thanks to you, - First time waiting in line, right?

00:53:10.426 --> 00:53:13.796
- I did things I never would've. - We're really doing it all today.

00:53:14.326 --> 00:53:15.866
Staring into the fire, and now staring at the rain.

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:19.636
- And when you took my side, - Are you crazy?

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:21.866
- it was cute. I was grateful. - Who are you to say that?

00:53:22.436 --> 00:53:23.936
You were cute too.

00:53:24.606 --> 00:53:26.476
- Because of my ex, - I'm not giving you my number.

00:53:26.776 --> 00:53:28.146
you'd get jealous.

00:53:28.476 --> 00:53:30.706
- Hey. - And you tried to look my age.

00:53:35.516 --> 00:53:37.186
Even though you're younger than me,

00:53:37.746 --> 00:53:41.326
in some ways, you were more mature and considerate than I was.

00:53:42.256 --> 00:53:43.326
And poised.

00:53:45.996 --> 00:53:47.396
I learned a lot from you.

00:53:48.596 --> 00:53:49.666
So I...

00:53:50.266 --> 00:53:51.896
couldn't help but fall in love with you.

00:53:53.036 --> 00:53:54.906
I just liked you.

00:54:01.306 --> 00:54:02.606
Ever since middle school,

00:54:03.646 --> 00:54:05.516
I'd always find an excuse to come over to your house.

00:54:07.746 --> 00:54:09.616
I only became friends with Ji Hyuk just to see you.

00:54:11.456 --> 00:54:13.886
Your parents gave me so much love.

00:54:15.626 --> 00:54:16.986
If it weren't for them,

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:21.196
I could've been selfish.

00:54:23.296 --> 00:54:24.366
You can't do that.

00:54:26.036 --> 00:54:27.366
I can't either.

00:54:28.766 --> 00:54:31.636
I can't just go and break my parents' hearts.

00:54:33.906 --> 00:54:34.906
We can't.

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:47.586
I'm breaking up with you.

00:54:57.496 --> 00:54:58.496
Okay.

00:55:00.366 --> 00:55:01.466
I'm breaking up...

00:55:02.666 --> 00:55:03.766
with you too.

00:55:21.356 --> 00:55:23.686
I wanted to take such good care of you.

00:55:25.256 --> 00:55:27.456
They say this kind of love isn't right.

00:55:29.266 --> 00:55:31.836
They might say a love like a mother's love is wrong, but...

00:55:34.836 --> 00:55:37.566
Even though you didn't get much love from your own mother,

00:55:40.636 --> 00:55:43.076
I wanted to make sure you never felt that void...

00:55:44.146 --> 00:55:46.676
and give you all the love I had.

00:55:51.516 --> 00:55:52.586
No.

00:55:54.856 --> 00:55:56.126
You already have.

00:55:59.026 --> 00:56:00.056
Su Bin.

00:56:01.356 --> 00:56:02.996
Every single moment I spent with you...

00:56:04.066 --> 00:56:05.336
was wonderful, and I was happy.

00:56:06.636 --> 00:56:07.736
And you...

00:56:09.206 --> 00:56:10.336
gave me...

00:56:10.906 --> 00:56:13.536
more than I could ever have imagined.

00:56:21.886 --> 00:56:22.986
Thank you for everything.

00:56:30.226 --> 00:56:31.756
I'm so glad.

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:37.126
It's true.

00:56:38.996 --> 00:56:40.036
Hey.

00:56:41.666 --> 00:56:42.766
Take care of yourself.

00:56:51.716 --> 00:56:52.716
Yes.

00:56:55.016 --> 00:56:56.046
Su Bin.

00:56:57.886 --> 00:56:59.116
I hope you find someone good.

00:57:02.686 --> 00:57:03.686
Yes.

00:57:07.756 --> 00:57:08.796
You too.

00:57:11.366 --> 00:57:12.366
I'm leaving.

00:57:15.536 --> 00:57:16.566
Goodbye.

00:58:00.946 --> 00:58:03.586
(Director Ko Seong Hui)

00:58:10.356 --> 00:58:11.386
Hello?

00:58:12.156 --> 00:58:15.766
- You've found Woo Jin, haven't you? - Well, I don't know about that.

00:58:15.826 --> 00:58:18.166
No, wait. You didn't even have to look for him, did you?

00:58:18.866 --> 00:58:20.596
Because you're the one who hid him away.

00:58:21.236 --> 00:58:23.866
You still talk about Woo Jin as if he's property.

00:58:24.836 --> 00:58:26.206
Hid him away?

00:58:26.806 --> 00:58:29.276
Han Woo Jin went off to live his own life.

00:58:30.176 --> 00:58:32.546
Why don't you just let him be?

00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:34.846
Live your own life.

00:58:35.286 --> 00:58:38.486
If you have any conscience at all, leave Woo Jin alone!

00:58:39.386 --> 00:58:42.526
Who do you think you are to go on about Woo Jin's life?

00:58:43.756 --> 00:58:47.426
I know better than anyone. I went through the same thing.

00:58:48.996 --> 00:58:52.996
You came to me sophisticated, decent, and elegant.

00:58:53.336 --> 00:58:56.036
Pretending to be this grateful woman.

00:58:56.436 --> 00:58:59.406
And you made me like you and trust you.

00:59:00.936 --> 00:59:04.446
Imagine how it was for Woo Jin, whom you've gaslit all his life.

00:59:06.076 --> 00:59:07.146
He is my son.

00:59:07.776 --> 00:59:08.916
Tell me where he is!

00:59:10.716 --> 00:59:13.886
You tell me to spit it out, and you think I will?

00:59:14.986 --> 00:59:16.156
Stop looking for Woo Jin.

00:59:17.326 --> 00:59:19.456
I said, let him live his own life.

00:59:20.796 --> 00:59:22.466
If you don't back off from Woo Jin,

00:59:23.766 --> 00:59:25.266
I won't go easy on you.

00:59:31.806 --> 00:59:33.006
You won't go easy on me?

00:59:37.776 --> 00:59:42.216
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:59:49.386 --> 00:59:50.386
Get out.

00:59:55.796 --> 00:59:58.226
(Order Details)

00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:00.596
I'm a customer.

01:00:01.066 --> 01:00:02.536
We're not serving you.

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:09.876
Will you kick out a paying customer, Ji Eun Oh's little brother?

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:16.146
- Why on earth are you here again? - Get Eun Oh for me.

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:18.086
I'm not leaving until she's here.

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:24.826
She what?

01:00:25.126 --> 01:00:28.496
She has murderous eyes. I don't think she'll leave.

01:00:30.726 --> 01:00:32.566
Since she ordered and is acting like a customer,

01:00:33.366 --> 01:00:34.936
we can't even call the cops.

01:00:41.206 --> 01:00:42.306
Eun Oh.

01:00:43.746 --> 01:00:45.916
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:48.846
Just make sure Mom calms down.

01:00:49.986 --> 01:00:51.286
I'll keep a close eye on her.

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:02.526
Okay. Here I am.

01:01:03.466 --> 01:01:04.796
Let's do this the easy way.

01:01:05.296 --> 01:01:06.836
Tell me where Woo Jin is.

01:01:07.666 --> 01:01:10.206
You know he's at Dongwoo Hospital in Busan, right?

01:01:11.066 --> 01:01:15.446
Find his outpatient schedule. You can wait and see him then.

01:01:15.506 --> 01:01:16.506
No.

01:01:17.246 --> 01:01:19.576
Bring him back to the hospital in Seoul. Right now.

01:01:20.146 --> 01:01:21.276
And why would I do that?

01:01:22.116 --> 01:01:25.886
Woo Jin is done living life on your terms.

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:29.386
He won't stand for it, and neither will I.

01:01:31.686 --> 01:01:34.096
You're the one who put these ideas in his head, aren't you?

01:01:35.296 --> 01:01:38.096
I knew it. It was you.

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:40.496
Are we done here?

01:01:41.436 --> 01:01:43.036
I believe I've warned you before.

01:01:43.636 --> 01:01:46.406
To stay away from my mom's restaurant.

01:01:47.436 --> 01:01:48.476
Eun Oh.

01:01:48.976 --> 01:01:51.506
Do you have any idea how I found you?

01:01:52.116 --> 01:01:55.516
Woo Jin is half the universe I built.

01:01:55.886 --> 01:01:57.386
And you expect me to give that up?

01:01:58.446 --> 01:02:00.416
This restaurant you hold so dear...

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:01.986
How about I shut it down in a month?

01:02:02.626 --> 01:02:03.626
What?

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:07.856
Health violation, food poisoning... The possibilities are endless.

01:02:08.666 --> 01:02:11.126
And you think it'll end there?

01:02:12.366 --> 01:02:14.296
What about your mother and your brother?

01:02:16.136 --> 01:02:18.776
I'll make it so they can't function in society.

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:23.706
They can live comfortably at home on your dime.

01:02:24.106 --> 01:02:26.746
- Are you finished? - Just give me Woo Jin.

01:02:28.216 --> 01:02:31.616
Listen to me. I gave you a million dollars.

01:02:31.686 --> 01:02:33.416
And you took the money.

01:02:34.286 --> 01:02:37.126
That means our accounts are settled.

01:02:37.456 --> 01:02:40.726
You took what was yours. For you to interfere in our lives...

01:02:40.796 --> 01:02:42.196
is a breach of our agreement.

01:02:51.336 --> 01:02:52.606
For now, please just leave.

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:57.846
Especially your brother.

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:03.346
He'll never work or run a business for as long as he lives.

01:03:03.416 --> 01:03:04.916
I get it. Now, just go!

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:09.486
Send me Woo Jin's whereabouts by midnight tonight.

01:03:24.866 --> 01:03:26.906
- I'm just stepping out. - Eun Oh.

01:03:27.006 --> 01:03:28.036
Eun Oh.

01:03:29.646 --> 01:03:30.646
Eun Oh!

01:04:02.146 --> 01:04:03.306
What's she doing here?

01:04:19.126 --> 01:04:20.256
Wait, Eun Oh?

01:04:23.996 --> 01:04:24.996
Why...

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:40.976
Eun Oh.

01:04:41.946 --> 01:04:42.946
Vice President.

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:45.516
What are you doing here?

01:04:51.486 --> 01:04:53.896
Eun Oh, why are you with my mother?

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:18.246
So you know each other?

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:31.366
Don't tell me...

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:34.536
Is she your birth mother?

01:06:22.216 --> 01:06:24.446
(Our Golden Days)

01:06:24.516 --> 01:06:28.156
Please, let me get an interview. Anywhere.

01:06:28.256 --> 01:06:31.156
You even declared me dead. And without a body, no less.

01:06:31.226 --> 01:06:34.496
How did you manage to do that? And how much does your husband know?

01:06:34.556 --> 01:06:36.796
I can't believe that she-devil is Seong Jae's stepmom.

01:06:37.366 --> 01:06:38.726
Sorry, I guess I was just a little shocked.

01:06:38.836 --> 01:06:39.996
The thing you're trying to do!

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:43.966
If I take the fall for this, do you want your dad to see that?

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:46.276
Thank you for raising me.

01:06:48.236 --> 01:06:51.276
Isn't this ridiculous? Who am I living like this for?

01:06:51.346 --> 01:06:53.646
Honey! You're all trying to kill me, aren't you?

01:06:53.716 --> 01:06:54.716
That darn witch.
