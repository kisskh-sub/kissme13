Your Majesty,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.880
I have something to report.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.159
Speak.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.399
Your Majesty,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.880
the traitors

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.960
lied to Your Majesty.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.240
Even if their bodies are burned,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.890
we still can't appease the people's rage.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.479
However, burning the dead bodies
will pollute the air

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.790
and affect Your Majesty's health.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.190
Your Majesty, please allow me

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.359
to dispose of the bodies
at the mass graves.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.320
His Majesty is the one

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.320
chosen by destiny.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.920
There are no phantoms and spirits
that His Majesty can't subdue.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.599
It's just a few bodies.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:11.590
There's nothing to worry about.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.840
His Majesty's might is overwhelming.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.439
Everything will be set right.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.959
Your Majesty,

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:22.680
I think the bodies should not
be burned in the open

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.239
because it ruins
the image of the capital.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.319
All right.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.799
Lord Pei,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.120
you're right.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.475
I will

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.680
let you deal with

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.159
the bodies of these traitors.

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:46.439
I believe

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.280
you won't disappoint me.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.159
I will

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:53.840
deal with it appropriately.

everything has been settled.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.990
I found a few bodies
of criminals who were executed in secret

and burned them
in the Shen family's place.

Just leave it here.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.839
I'll eat it later.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.000
Miss,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.959
I know

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:04.399
you still have many things to do,

but no matter how busy you are,

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.519
you must take good care of your body.

Don't worry.

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:12.879
I still need to give you

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:14.920
and Yunqi

Miss,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.680
I just want

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.920
to be with Young Master
until he grows up

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.639
and be with you

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.680
until you get married and have children.

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:33.639
That's right, Miss.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.839
One more thing.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.879
Li Wan'er's nanny is here.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.279
She wants to meet you.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.399
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:58.240
Rise.

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:01.600
Lord Pei,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.879
this item looks familiar.

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:07.399
Do you recognise it?

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:14.720
Your Majesty,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.439
this ring's material
and workmanship are top-notch.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.879
Moreover, it has the Shen family's mark.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.879
It should belong to the Shen family.

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.839
Didn't you burn the bodies of
the traitors of the Shen family?

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:31.959
Why is his ring

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.240
still intact?

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:38.480
Most of the Shen family's assets
have been seized.

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:40.720
However, the Shen family was rich

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.780
and had a wide influence.

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:44.519
Some of its assets
might be purchased by other people.

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:48.279
Please give me some time.

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.970
I will surely find all the assets
that belonged to the Shen family.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.319
All right.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.720
I've always been satisfied
with your work.

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:02.040
However,

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.480
Consort Shu doesn't know
what's appropriate.

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:06.187
I ordered her

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:07.639
to move out of Yanfu Palace.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.839
I assign you

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.920
to send her to the cold palace.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.360
Sister.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.480
Sister.

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.480
I've caused you trouble.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:46.700
Do you still remember the straw house
we lived in when we were young?

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:48.480
This place is

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.500
so much better compared to before.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.600
Moreover,

00:07:53.167 --> 00:07:54.086
it's quiet here.

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:55.800
There aren't many rumors here.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.079
I can finally take a break.

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:00.920
Sister,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.879
with me around,

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.000
I will definitely solve this matter.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.560
Consort Pei colluded
with her natal relatives

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.839
to interfere in state affairs.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.990
It is in violation
of the ancestral injunctions.

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:30.240
She will be banished
to the cold palace from today onwards.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.120
Yu,

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:02.759
I chose this path myself.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:05.639
Remember.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.970
The more you care about someone,

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.340
the more that person

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.240
will be your weakness.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:31.279
Sister!

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.360
Wait for me.

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:50.720
Her Highness says

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.639
this must be handed to you in person.

00:10:02.925 --> 00:10:03.712
(For Shen Changning)

00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:30.399
Run.

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:31.480
Hurry!

00:10:53.559 --> 00:10:54.399
Let go of them!

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:05.639
Lian.

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:10.960
Young Lady.

00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:12.519
It's fine.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.159
You saved

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:16.159
my life.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.080
I'm very happy

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.120
to save you.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.399
I'm going to meet

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:25.320
Master and Madam.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.559
I will tell them

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:29.600
that you will

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.440
support

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.320
the whole

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.720
Shen family.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:44.120
Lian!

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.159
Sorry!

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.600
Sorry!

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:49.840
Lian!

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.440
I don't want you to die!

00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:01.639

00:12:22.039 --> 00:12:22.720

Governor,

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:45.120
I've investigated it.

00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:46.279
The assassin

00:12:47.075 --> 00:12:48.320
is the emperor's guard.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.440
Cry if you feel sad.

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:21.900
Don't keep it inside.

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:29.679
I won't cry.

00:13:35.162 --> 00:13:36.600
I'm going to avenge Lian.

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:39.512
I'm going to avenge the Shen family.

00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:43.037
(End of Episode)

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:44.759
Why would I feel reluctant

when she's just a courtesan?

00:13:49.159 --> 00:13:51.000
The emperor sees the Shen family
as a pawn.

00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:53.200
Do you not see me as a tool, as well?

00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:57.480
