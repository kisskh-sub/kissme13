[Strange Chronicles of Tang]

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.010
[Episode 20]

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.740
It really is poisonous.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.240
And it's definitely strychnine.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.890
This is my

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.380
and Official Lu's friend,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.440
Chicken Fei,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.490
a disciple of the King of Medicine.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.870
A disciple of the King of Medicine
would never lie.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.120
In that case,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.760
I thank you all for saving my life.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.690
No need for thanks.

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.840
Let's go see the painting first.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.620
I've long heard about this painting,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.000
but never had the chance to see it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.400
I never expected it to be so lifelike.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.070
I painted this from memory,

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.400
copying as best I could.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.350
I had little time, so it's not very good.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.759
I must seem ridiculous to you, Sir.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:34.280
No, no.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:35.920
It's very well done.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.240
Look here.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.250
This is Emperor Xiaojing.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.350
This one

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.470
is me.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.250
I was the Director
of the Imperial Stables then.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.490
Then this officer

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.990
must be Zhu Ling.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.640
Yes.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.490
At that time, Grand General Zhu

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.710
was the Crown Prince's Left Guard

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.509
and Ranking Officer
of the Crown Prince's Guard.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.100
This is Zheng Zhong.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.080
He was the Deputy Director
of the Imperial Catering then.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.460
What about the others?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.240
This is a palace maid.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.010
Because of her strong arms,

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.400
Emperor Xiaojing taught her to play polo.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.130
Do you remember her name?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.560
Something with Cui, I think.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.780
Bo Cui?

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.000
Yes, that's the name.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.040
What about this person?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.079
His back is turned.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.540
How could I recognize him?

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.280
However,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.040
this one catching the polo ball
by the pool

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.190
is a young eunuch.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.620
He was very clever.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.430
Emperor Xiaojing called him Xi.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.520
A few years ago, I saw him on the street

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.240
once.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.780
He had become a beggar.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.190
I believe he was expelled from the palace

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.200
for stealing.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.710
Sir,

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.280
please wait a moment.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.340
I'll be right back.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.710
You two,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.980
stop speaking in riddles.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.960
Are you trying to drive me mad
with anxiety?

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.870
Three days ago,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.840
a body was found in Wannian County.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.710
According to the examination,

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.110
death was caused by strychnine poisoning,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.440
and there was a blow to the head.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.920
I just re-examined the body and discovered

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.740
that he was a eunuch.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.940
Xi?

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.600
How can this painting

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.220
be so eerily connected?

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.290
I'm afraid the murderer deliberately

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800
killed according to this painting.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.120
This reminds me

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.710
of the Stone Bridge Painting
from Nanzhou Prefecture.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.930
If that's the case,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.000
this unidentified person in the painting

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.260
might be the murderer.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.950
According to Ma Meng,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.430
in the entire Palace Secretariat,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.750
no one knows

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.730
who the artist of this painting is.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.460
Therefore,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.860
the identity of this figure
with his back turned...

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.030
The old archives
of the Ministry of Personnel

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.070
should contain

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.990
records of officials who served

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.800
in the Eastern Palace back then.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.680
I just remembered someone else—

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.910
the current Ghost Market Magistrate,
Feng Tai.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.630
He likes to collect

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.610
all sorts of strange curiosities.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.120
Emperor Xiaojing was also playful,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.830
so he often invited him
to the Eastern Palace.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.170
Go find him.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.030
Perhaps,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.540
he can recall events from those days.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.600
In that case,

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.650
we'll split into 2 groups.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.270
I'll trouble you two county sheriffs

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.750
to make a trip to the Ghost Market.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.280
Yingtao, you protect them.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.480
Xue Huan, Xijun,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.600
come with me to the Ministry of Personnel

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.860
to search through the archives tonight.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.690
W-What about me?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.230
We've all been busy lately.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.440
You've been running

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.270
the sushan shop all by yourself.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.530
You must be exhausted.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.950
Go home and get some rest.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.409
I am rather tired.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.680
Wait.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.630
This can detect poison.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.020
And also...

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.910
This one.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.210
If the poisoning isn't severe,

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.270
it can save lives.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.110
Thank you.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.230
By the way,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.800
give me the painting.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.870
[Ghost Market]

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.910
Let me take a look.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.480
You've certainly found the right person.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.190
[Feng Tai, Ghost Market Magistrate]

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.230
Forty years ago,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.270
I often visited the Eastern Palace.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.040
That's right.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.120
This is Crown Prince Hong.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.980
When he died,

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.940
I wept for 3 days and nights.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.750
I thought the Tang Empire's fortune

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.270
would decline from then on.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.000
Unexpectedly, it has continued until today

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.200
and shows signs of growing prosperity.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.590
Look.

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:56.580
Isn't this you?

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.480
Yes.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Magistrate Feng.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.080
We wanted you to identify

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.680
who this person is.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:06.600
This man

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.490
is Tutu Wenzhen.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.420
Yes.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.490
It's him.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.240
He was

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.390
Emperor Xiaojing's most trusted
palace attendant.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.450
How could I have forgotten about him?

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.480
Thank you, Old Master Feng.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.990
Let's hurry back

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.300
to find Tutu Wenzhen's whereabouts.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.360
No need to search.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.950
He's right here in my Ghost Market.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.040
After retirement, he had nowhere to go,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.300
so he became my clerk at the Ghost Market.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.000
Behind the Earth God Temple
in the Ghost Market,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.930
there's a house.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.870
He works, eats, and lives there.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:37.680
Perfect!

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.950
Please lead the way.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.870
Move aside.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.240
Why isn't he opening the door yet?

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.040
If I hadn't received
the temporary residence permit,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.360
which can be exchanged for
a long-term residence permit after a year

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.040
to register as a citizen

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.310
after 3 years in Chang'an,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.570
I wouldn't bother with this damn permit.

Since we've waited so long,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.250
let's wait a bit longer.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.560
Maybe the old eunuch

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.830
had too much to drink,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.450
so he's not waking up?

Punishment rectifies evil.

If the law can't correct evil,

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.240
then someone
will take matters into their own hands.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.240
As they say, those who do many wrongs

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.320
will bring about their own demise.

all refer to you

was Emperor Xiaojing's teacher,

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.150
Guo Yu.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.650
He was a true Confucian Master.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.330
I can't even hope to catch up to him.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:09.320
I'm leaving.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.550
[The Lament of the Imperial Scandal]

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.080
Liu.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.800
What have you been busy with lately?

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.270
Busy with what I should be doing.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.800
Can you share some details?

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.800
Confucius said,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.320
"As in piling up earth
to erect a mountain,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.870
if, with only one basketful
short of completion,

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:24.510
I stop,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.750
I have stopped.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.630
As in filling a ditch to level the ground,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.360
if, having dumped in only one basketful,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.020
I continue,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.500
I am progressing."

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.660
I, Liu Zigui,

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.760
will never fail when success is at hand.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.070
You still haven't told me
what you've been doing.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.870
You'll know when the time comes.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.680
The sentence just now

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.670
isn't from the "Spring and Autumn Annals."

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.130
It's from the "Zi Han" chapter
of "The Analects of Confucius."

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.720
[Unwavering Integrity]

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.170
You old fool,

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.160
you're already prepared.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.480
Ma Meng?

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.320
Deputy Director of the Palace Secretariat?

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.190
Now it's good you know

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.150
I'm from His Majesty's side.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.920
Since I'm here to take your life,

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.170
it means His Majesty demands your life.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.040
This is bestowed upon you by His Majesty.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:02.750
Take it.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.930
The "His Majesty" you speak of

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.370
isn't the current Emperor, is he?

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.190
You old fool.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.650
It seems you still remember

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.100
the evil you've done.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.490
You're right.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.150
I'm here on Emperor Xiaojing's orders

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.390
to claim your life.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.900
You jerk,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.360
playing tricks!

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.390
I'll capture you

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.010
and avenge Zhu Ling and Zheng Zhong!

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.150
[Unwavering Integrity]

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.030
Old fool,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.320
you still think of revenge?

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.050
Sheriff Wei, you may take a rest!

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.510
I'm Chu Yingtao,
a secret agent of Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.080
I'm here to capture the criminal!

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.890
A woman?

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.940
I won't fight you—

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.130
don't throw your life away.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.110
We'll see who dies today!

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.520
Who goes there?

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.150
I'm Lu Lingfeng
from the Yongzhou Judicial Office.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.350
Surrender now.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.390
I've heard much about you.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.080
It seems

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.370
I've fallen into a trap.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.480
I can't fail when so close to success.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.200
Have at you!

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.040
Using hidden weapons before me?

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:54.630
Yingtao, don't!

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.030
This person is involved
in multiple murders.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.630
The 3 judicial departments
must jointly interrogate him

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.160
and record his confession.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.960
You want to interrogate me?

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.680
Dream on!

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.240
I'm the Deputy Director
of the Palace Secretariat,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.640
from His Majesty's side.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.110
What can you do to me?

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.320
Deputy Director of the Palace Secretariat?

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.810
You don't really think

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.270
you are Ma Meng, do you?

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.140
Secretariat Ma,

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.280
come out now.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.440
How have you transformed

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.570
into my appearance?

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.720
If I'm not mistaken,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.600
this is a kind of

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.530
extremely thin mask.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.240
The mold

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.390
must be made from the real person's face.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.320
Secretariat Ma,

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.620
you need to carefully recall

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.390
who would have such an opportunity.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.480
Having just arrived in the capital,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.940
I don't have many friends.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.390
Only my classmate Liu Zigui

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.630
is particularly close to me.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.490
I drank with him

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.030
and listened to his exposition
on the "Spring and Autumn Annals."

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.430
Once I got drunk,
I stayed at Liu's Mansion.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.400
Liu,

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.210
it can't really be you, can it?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.340
Ma Meng,

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.140
you were born into a humble family,

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.470
with mediocre talents,

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.630
yet you had the chance to become
Deputy Director of the Palace Secretariat.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.760
On the contrary, I am

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.670
a descendant of a famous Confucian,

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.960
well-versed
in the "Spring and Autumn Annals,"

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.790
yet I received no recognition.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.080
It's all because the current Emperor
is incompetent.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.150
If Emperor Xiaojing were still alive,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.270
I would have become

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.930
the chancellor by now.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.630
Liu Zigui!

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.440
Drop your disguise now!

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.980
I refuse.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.330
If you can't capture me,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.770
I certainly won't confess.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.240
Last night at the Ministry of Personnel,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.440
while reviewing
the Eastern Palace's files,

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.620
I discovered a name,

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.810
Guo Sigong.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.550
If Emperor Xiaojing

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.770
hadn't suddenly passed away,

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.200
this man would have entered
the Eastern Palace

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:31.720
and

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.510
would have been entrusted
with important duties.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.900
Also,

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.480
Old Master Feng, Ghost Market Magistrate,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.200
also saw
"The Lament of the Imperial Scandal"

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.590
and recalled a past event.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.670
So you're Grand Tutor Guo's son.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.290
Do you play polo?

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.240
No.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.690
That's rather unfortunate.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.680
Although I don't play polo,

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.810
I've been skilled at painting
since childhood.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:15:59.420
I would like to

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.870
[Guo Sigong, Son of Guo Yu]

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.600
paint a polo scene for you, Your Highness.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.900
That's a good idea.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.290
When the rain stops,

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.000
I'll call them

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.130
to play polo with me.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.670
I'd like to see

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.500
how well you can paint.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.640
This painting

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.690
will surely be remembered for generations.
