00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:02.067
Are you feeling better now?

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:02.167
Are you feeling better now?

00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:05.254
Yes.

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:06.922
You must've been startled.

00:01:08.173 --> 00:01:10.843
Of all days for this to happen…

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.888
-What was that call about?
-Excuse me?

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.933
You didn't look too great
after getting that call.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.769
Oh, that.

00:01:21.812 --> 00:01:23.606
It wasn't anything serious.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:26.108
It happens often, but…

00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:32.990
Jeez.

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:35.242
-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me.

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:41.790
A while back…

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.544
Never mind.

00:01:45.628 --> 00:01:46.837
What about a while back?

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.176
Anyway, what did you want to
tell me today?

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.387
You never got to say it.

00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:58.140
Oh, it wasn't anything important.

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.226
I just called to have tea with you.

00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:06.440
You just wanted to have tea with me?

00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:07.483
Yes.

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:13.739
You have something to say.

00:02:13.822 --> 00:02:14.907
No, I don't.

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:22.164
I said I don't. What's wrong with you?

00:02:22.665 --> 00:02:23.582
Come on.

00:02:24.708 --> 00:02:26.168
What is it about?

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:28.003
Tell me.

00:02:29.838 --> 00:02:30.756
What was it?

00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:35.177
EPISODE 13

00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:42.726
Oh, man.

00:02:44.603 --> 00:02:46.730
-Mother.
-Jae-hyeong!

00:02:47.314 --> 00:02:49.858
What's going on?
What happened to your face?

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:50.943
Who did this to you?

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:52.861
Over there.

00:02:56.532 --> 00:02:57.783
What?

00:02:57.866 --> 00:02:59.034
Hyeon-jun.

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:00.786
Look at your face.

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:02.830
What's going on? What happened?

00:03:02.913 --> 00:03:04.999
-Jeez, just go and check on her.
-Huh?

00:03:05.082 --> 00:03:06.375
Just go already.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.505
Here you go, Mother.

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:12.881
Wipe your tears.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.594
Hello?

00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:18.595
Mr. Hwang.

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:20.931
Sorry, just a minute.

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:28.105
Me? Why?

00:03:29.314 --> 00:03:30.190
Director.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.693
I'm not shooting with her.

00:03:33.277 --> 00:03:36.655
When that article about her came out,
I was utterly humiliated.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.282
But I let it go because I'm an actress.

00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:41.368
Even when we crossed paths
doing the same drama,

00:03:41.452 --> 00:03:42.995
I just accepted it.

00:03:43.078 --> 00:03:45.414
But you can't expect even someone like me

00:03:45.497 --> 00:03:47.750
to let it slide a second time, right?

00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:50.794
It's just how things go on a set.

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:53.380
There's always some tension and conflict.

00:03:53.464 --> 00:03:56.050
But we need to compromise
for the good of the show--

00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:58.218
I'm disappointed in you, too, Director.

00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:00.763
All I did was give it my best in acting.

00:04:00.846 --> 00:04:03.724
Mi-ran is the one who can't tell
reality from acting.

00:04:03.807 --> 00:04:05.434
-That was acting?
-What else would it be?

00:04:05.517 --> 00:04:07.686
You slapped me as hard as you could,
with every bit of emotion!

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.146
I never…

00:04:10.064 --> 00:04:11.774
-Director.
-Yes?

00:04:11.857 --> 00:04:13.358
I'm the one who's disappointed.

00:04:13.442 --> 00:04:15.861
I don't care if the lead actor
asked you for this favor.

00:04:15.944 --> 00:04:18.155
You can't treat casting
like some package deal.

00:04:18.238 --> 00:04:19.281
A package deal?

00:04:19.364 --> 00:04:21.241
That's not it at all, ma'am!

00:04:21.325 --> 00:04:24.078
Mr. Lim never asked
such a favor to begin with,

00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:27.498
and I've always been a big fan
of Ms. Seong's movies.

00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:30.834
So I'd been wanting
a chance to work with her.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.462
-Did you hear that?
-So now what?

00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:34.588
Should I drop out, then?

00:04:35.172 --> 00:04:36.298
Ms. Oh, please…

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:37.549
Mother.

00:04:47.392 --> 00:04:48.769
Mom, just apologize.

00:04:48.852 --> 00:04:51.980
Why are you telling me to apologize?
I was just acting.

00:04:52.064 --> 00:04:54.108
Then why is Ms. Oh so upset?

00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:56.568
She's just jealous
of my superb acting skills.

00:04:57.528 --> 00:04:59.655
She'd have no reason to feel that way.

00:04:59.738 --> 00:05:01.365
The script only said one slap,

00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:05.119
but you got excited at the opportunity
and slapped her twice!

00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:08.914
It's true that I can't stand Oh Mi-ran,
but I'm an actress myself.

00:05:08.997 --> 00:05:10.457
I was just doing my job.

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:15.504
All right, fine.
Just apologize to her first, okay?

00:05:15.587 --> 00:05:16.421
No.

00:05:17.714 --> 00:05:18.632
Will you quit, then?

00:05:18.715 --> 00:05:22.052
She claims you slapped her with emotion.
You won't win this fight!

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:24.346
Stop making this worse and just apologize.

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:26.557
Why should I apologize?

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.308
Because you got this role, thanks to me.

00:05:28.392 --> 00:05:30.269
I basically got you the role.

00:05:30.894 --> 00:05:32.646
Do it for me and just apologize.

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.273
I said I don't want to!

00:05:34.356 --> 00:05:37.025
Why should I apologize
when I did nothing wrong?

00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:52.166
Let's wrap it up for the day.

00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:53.667
Excuse me?

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.128
Okay, sir.

00:05:57.546 --> 00:06:00.340

EDITORIAL DESK

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:06.555
I'm heading out.

00:06:06.638 --> 00:06:08.891
-Goodbye.
-Have a good night.

00:06:08.974 --> 00:06:09.892
Let's see here.

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:18.108
It wasn't anything serious.

00:06:18.192 --> 00:06:19.902
It happens often, but…

00:06:21.862 --> 00:06:22.863
It happened again today.

PANIC DISORDER

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.748
WHAT IS A PANIC DISORDER?

00:06:32.831 --> 00:06:34.124
A TYPE OF ANXIETY DISORDER
CAUSING SUDDEN, INTENSE FEAR.

00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:39.755
SYMPTOMS USUALLY PEAK WITHIN 10 MINUTES.

00:06:39.838 --> 00:06:41.632
-Panic disorder?
-You scared me.

00:06:41.715 --> 00:06:45.427
It's nothing.
I was just doing some research.

00:06:46.053 --> 00:06:47.429
What's with the face?

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.474
What about it?

00:06:52.267 --> 00:06:54.061
You look like a guy dumped you.

00:06:54.144 --> 00:06:56.021
Nobody dumped me.

00:06:59.274 --> 00:07:00.484
Chief.

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:01.443
By the way…

00:07:04.488 --> 00:07:06.823
What you said about
celebrity and non-celebrity couples

00:07:06.907 --> 00:07:08.283
always ending in disaster…

00:07:08.867 --> 00:07:09.993
Do you really believe that?

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:12.955
Why? Is someone dating a celebrity?

00:07:13.038 --> 00:07:14.122
No, well…

00:07:15.624 --> 00:07:16.625
It's my friend.

00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:20.963
I don't think
they're officially dating yet,

00:07:21.046 --> 00:07:22.798
but the guy lied to her.

00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:23.924
About what?

00:07:24.007 --> 00:07:25.842
He lied about being a celebrity.

00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:28.428
How could he not tell her
something so important?

00:07:28.512 --> 00:07:30.973
Imagine how betrayed she must feel.

00:07:33.225 --> 00:07:34.351
So?

00:07:35.143 --> 00:07:36.186
She's not going to see him?

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.938
I don't know.

00:07:40.274 --> 00:07:43.026
Well, even if I were dating him,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.445
the thought of being publicly dismissed

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:47.698
and being kept in the shadows

00:07:48.282 --> 00:07:49.658
makes me shrink back.

00:07:49.741 --> 00:07:52.577
Shrink back? That's not like you.

00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:55.080
I didn't get it at first either,

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:58.041
but now that I've gone through it,
I get it now.

00:08:02.504 --> 00:08:04.881
You're so pathetic.

00:08:04.965 --> 00:08:06.717
You should a write a book
on being pathetic.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.635
You'd sell millions of copies.

00:08:11.013 --> 00:08:11.888
Pathetic?

00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:14.182
Oh, wait.

00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:15.851
I was talking about my friend, not me!

00:08:15.934 --> 00:08:17.269
Don't get me wrong, Chief!

00:08:17.352 --> 00:08:19.521
-It's my friend!
-I didn't say anything.

00:08:21.565 --> 00:08:23.233
Damn it.

00:08:31.283 --> 00:08:33.243
Oh man, what a day.

00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:42.419
Seriously.

00:08:47.424 --> 00:08:48.258
Who's calling?

00:08:48.342 --> 00:08:49.426
CHIEF YUN HWA-YEONG, SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:50.385
What?

00:08:55.223 --> 00:08:56.266
Hello, Ms. Yun.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.393
Why do you sound so exhausted?

00:08:58.477 --> 00:08:59.394
Well, my mom…

00:09:01.897 --> 00:09:05.484
No, never mind. I'm just tired.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.028
Anyway, why did you call?

00:09:08.111 --> 00:09:10.280
Can we meet up right now?

00:09:10.364 --> 00:09:11.365
Excuse me?

00:09:11.448 --> 00:09:12.657
Right now?

00:09:12.741 --> 00:09:13.825
At this hour?

00:09:20.248 --> 00:09:23.251
Why would you call me out at this hour?

00:09:23.335 --> 00:09:24.586
I'm exhausted.

00:09:25.337 --> 00:09:26.797
I'm busy myself, you know.

00:09:27.422 --> 00:09:30.300
-I'm not here to chat.
-Of course you're not.

00:09:30.384 --> 00:09:32.386
So what's this about?

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.098
Are things going well
between you and Wi Jeong-sin?

00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:37.265
Yes, of course.

00:09:37.349 --> 00:09:38.975
We even met up today, but…

00:09:40.936 --> 00:09:43.021
Something came up today,

00:09:43.814 --> 00:09:45.690
so we didn't really get a chance to talk.

00:09:45.774 --> 00:09:48.610
You need to step it up.
Things don't look good right now.

00:09:50.278 --> 00:09:51.738
-They don't look good?
-No.

00:09:51.822 --> 00:09:54.950
You might not get the answer
you're looking from her.

00:09:55.033 --> 00:09:57.160
I suggest that you prepare for the worst.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.667
But I thought things were going well
between her and me lately.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.002
Mr. Lim, you and Wi Jeong-sin

00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:08.630
come from two completely different worlds.

00:10:08.713 --> 00:10:11.800
Different worlds, my ass.
We both live in Seoul.

00:10:13.176 --> 00:10:14.594
What I'm saying is

00:10:14.678 --> 00:10:17.848
that if you came from an outer planet,

00:10:17.931 --> 00:10:19.766
Wi Jeong-sin is someone from Earth.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.894
If you're an airplane
used to soaring above the clouds,

00:10:22.978 --> 00:10:27.482
Wi Jeong-sin is someone
who's used to walking on solid ground.

00:10:28.066 --> 00:10:30.193
I'm not saying you're better than her.

00:10:30.277 --> 00:10:32.612
I'm just saying
that's how wide the mental gap is

00:10:32.696 --> 00:10:34.072
between a top star and a non-celebrity.

00:10:34.156 --> 00:10:36.700
Jeez, I'm not a top star.

00:10:36.783 --> 00:10:38.869
I'm just a regular person.

00:10:38.952 --> 00:10:39.995
So what are you saying?

00:10:40.078 --> 00:10:42.247
Should I match her pace
and take things slowly?

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.582
So she won't feel pressured?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.461
No, just the opposite.
You need to give her reassurance.

00:10:47.544 --> 00:10:50.672
Don't hide your feelings.
Tell her repeatedly that you like her.

00:10:50.755 --> 00:10:52.090
Just keep telling her that.

00:10:52.674 --> 00:10:55.385
Jeez, you want me to
tell her again and again?

00:10:55.469 --> 00:10:57.345
Are you saying I should brainwash her?

00:10:57.429 --> 00:11:00.098
Besides, do you really think
that'll work on her?

00:11:01.057 --> 00:11:02.142
Come on, how is that…

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.312
How is that brainwashing her?

00:11:05.896 --> 00:11:08.940
All I said was to be honest
about your feelings.

00:11:10.066 --> 00:11:11.109
This is so frustrating.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.862
Do I really have to teach you everything?

00:11:13.945 --> 00:11:18.116
Are you saying I should
confess my love to her on my knees, then?

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.243
"Will you please make up your mind
and go out with me?"

00:11:20.327 --> 00:11:22.287
Do you want me to beg like that?

00:11:23.413 --> 00:11:24.498
Jeez.

00:11:29.294 --> 00:11:30.712
Is that what it'll take?

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.465

Our company's
internal monthly financial statements?

00:12:14.464 --> 00:12:15.298
Yes.

00:12:18.093 --> 00:12:20.595
Even though you're a reporter
and we know each other,

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:24.266
I can't show you those
because of our internal policies.

00:12:24.349 --> 00:12:25.809
I know it's a big ask,

00:12:26.977 --> 00:12:29.437
but if this continues,
King's Back will be at risk.

00:12:29.521 --> 00:12:30.605
What do you mean?

00:12:34.192 --> 00:12:37.654
All right, I'll think about it.

00:12:38.655 --> 00:12:39.489
Ms. Wi!

00:12:42.033 --> 00:12:44.327
What brings you here today?

00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:45.579
You didn't say you were coming.

00:12:46.913 --> 00:12:48.623
I came to talk about yesterday.

00:12:49.416 --> 00:12:52.669
I just had something
to discuss with Mr. Hwang.

00:12:54.129 --> 00:12:56.965
What could you two possibly have
to talk about without me?

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.676
Just something.

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:02.554
I'll leave you two to it, then.

00:13:02.637 --> 00:13:04.014
No, wait a minute.

00:13:04.097 --> 00:13:05.557
You're leaving already?

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.475
Yes. I'm done here, so I should go.

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:09.185
But I just got here.

00:13:20.905 --> 00:13:23.825
Oh, look. The scripts for Kang Pil-gu 5.

00:13:24.576 --> 00:13:25.910
It's all right here.

00:13:27.495 --> 00:13:30.707
Episodes seven and eight are great,
don't you think?

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.751
-Episodes seven and eight.
-Bro.

00:13:34.294 --> 00:13:36.004
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU
EPISODE 7

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.679
Do you want to take a look?

00:13:45.764 --> 00:13:46.640
Wait…

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.894
Gosh, would you look at this?

00:13:50.977 --> 00:13:53.146
You said you have a meeting.

00:13:53.229 --> 00:13:56.066
Are you sure it's okay
to let a reporter see the scripts?

00:13:56.149 --> 00:13:57.567
I'll take care of it.

00:13:57.651 --> 00:13:58.568
-Go on.
-Okay, fine.

00:13:58.652 --> 00:14:00.487
-Stop pushing me.
-All right.

00:14:01.112 --> 00:14:02.656
-I got it.
-Jeez.

00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:14.501
Please sit over there.

00:14:14.584 --> 00:14:15.418
Huh?

00:14:16.586 --> 00:14:17.921
-Why?
-Here.

00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:20.215
Well…

00:14:21.341 --> 00:14:23.093
I'll let you have a read,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.388
but you can't take them
because of security reasons.

00:14:27.555 --> 00:14:29.808
So you'll have to
read the whole thing here.

00:14:30.475 --> 00:14:33.269
But it'll take me
hours to get through them.

00:14:34.104 --> 00:14:35.313
That's fine with me.

00:14:35.397 --> 00:14:36.648
Take your time.

00:14:58.837 --> 00:15:01.256
Why are you sitting here?
Don't you have to go?

00:15:01.339 --> 00:15:02.298
Well, I…

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.385
I have to watch you,

00:15:05.468 --> 00:15:07.971
in case you take photos of the script.

00:15:08.722 --> 00:15:11.349
I'm not that unethical of a reporter.

00:15:12.642 --> 00:15:14.269
I'm just saying.

00:15:14.352 --> 00:15:16.646
Don't mind me. Go ahead and read.

00:15:17.856 --> 00:15:19.858
Would you like some coffee or cookies?

00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:21.109
No, thank you.

00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:42.589
You need to step it up.

00:15:42.672 --> 00:15:44.591
Things don't look good right now.

00:15:45.175 --> 00:15:48.136
If you're an airplane
used to soaring above the clouds,

00:15:48.219 --> 00:15:52.182
Wi Jeong-sin is someone
who's used to walking on solid ground.

00:15:55.727 --> 00:15:58.313
You know, as far as people's lives go,

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.941
they may seem completely different.

00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:05.320
But when you look closely,
they're all the same.

00:16:05.403 --> 00:16:09.657
It's all the same,
even for actors and top celebrities.

00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:10.617
Therefore,

00:16:11.659 --> 00:16:13.161
I'm just an ordinary guy too.

00:16:14.746 --> 00:16:15.580
Right.

00:16:15.663 --> 00:16:18.166
You could say
you're not exactly ordinary either.

00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:19.250
You went to Hankuk University.

00:16:20.877 --> 00:16:24.088
What does graduating from there
have to do with being ordinary?

00:16:24.172 --> 00:16:27.759
Graduating from Hankuk University
puts you among the top 0.1% of minds,

00:16:27.842 --> 00:16:29.677
and that's far from ordinary.

00:16:29.761 --> 00:16:31.387
It means you're a genius.

00:16:32.263 --> 00:16:33.348
I'm just a high school grad.

00:16:33.848 --> 00:16:36.392
I mean, a college dropout.

00:16:36.976 --> 00:16:38.478
I didn't ask you any of that.

00:16:41.231 --> 00:16:42.357
What I'm saying is…

00:16:45.735 --> 00:16:49.030
It's easy to be fooled
by my outstanding traits,

00:16:49.989 --> 00:16:50.949
but the truth is,

00:16:51.991 --> 00:16:53.993
I have a lot of shortcomings too.

00:16:54.077 --> 00:16:56.246
I'm well aware of your shortcomings.

00:17:04.963 --> 00:17:05.880
By the way,

00:17:07.382 --> 00:17:08.925
why did you ask to see me that day?

00:17:13.555 --> 00:17:15.139
Well, that was…

00:17:18.226 --> 00:17:19.102
Was it to tell me…

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.314
that you never wanted to see me again?

00:17:25.066 --> 00:17:27.652
"We come from
completely different worlds."

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.488
"We're not right for each other."

00:17:30.572 --> 00:17:33.283
Were you going to quote a line
like some '90s drama?

00:17:43.585 --> 00:17:44.711
Was that it?

00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:49.257
Then why didn't you say it?

00:17:51.968 --> 00:17:54.929
Because you seemed shaken
at the cafe that day.

00:17:57.432 --> 00:17:59.267
I was okay, thanks to you.

00:18:02.228 --> 00:18:04.063
I was fine
when we sat on the bench outside,

00:18:04.939 --> 00:18:05.815
which means

00:18:06.608 --> 00:18:08.359
you could've told me then.

00:18:09.569 --> 00:18:10.778
So why didn't you?

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:15.116
Maybe when you saw me,

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.285
you couldn't bring yourself to say…

00:18:19.704 --> 00:18:21.247
that you didn't want to see me.

00:18:42.894 --> 00:18:46.814
Really listen to your heart
and think about it.

00:18:47.398 --> 00:18:48.733
Ask yourself what it is

00:18:49.984 --> 00:18:50.818
that you really want.

00:18:55.615 --> 00:18:56.532
Take your time reading.

and I'll take care of the business.

00:19:27.689 --> 00:19:30.024
Let's turn the agency into
a comprehensive entertainment company.

00:19:30.108 --> 00:19:31.734
People call Mr. Lee Dae-ho a media mogul,

00:19:31.818 --> 00:19:34.612
but his newspapers make no profit
and are essentially empty shells.

00:19:34.696 --> 00:19:38.116
Do you even know where
the investment funds are coming from?

00:19:40.535 --> 00:19:43.246
I don't think I should sign this.

00:19:43.329 --> 00:19:46.249
Isn't this something you sign
when selling a company?

00:19:46.332 --> 00:19:48.835
It's just a formality,
so it's fine for you to sign it.

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:51.004
I see.

00:19:51.087 --> 00:19:52.255

But if this continues,
King's Back will be at risk.

00:19:57.301 --> 00:19:59.262
I don't think
I can sign this without reviewing.

00:20:00.054 --> 00:20:04.559
I'll discuss the matter with the others
before I sign it.

Thanks.

00:20:45.349 --> 00:20:46.184
For what?

00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:49.562
For holding the elevator for me.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.609
-Are you free tomorrow morning?
-No.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.944
Why?

00:20:57.028 --> 00:20:58.738
I was wondering
if you could take my son to kindergarten.

00:20:59.947 --> 00:21:02.700
-Me?
-Dads come to read to the kids.

00:21:02.784 --> 00:21:03.993
It's my son's turn tomorrow,

00:21:04.577 --> 00:21:06.162
so I was hoping you could fill in.

But…

00:21:22.178 --> 00:21:23.262
Hello?

00:21:23.846 --> 00:21:25.973

MOM'S ALWAYS RUNNING

00:21:40.238 --> 00:21:42.949
The due diligence team from Singapore
will be coming soon,

00:21:43.449 --> 00:21:44.283
so get ready.

00:21:44.784 --> 00:21:45.618
Yes, sir.

00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:49.872
And what should we do
about CEO Hwang of King's Back?

00:21:49.956 --> 00:21:51.082
He's being really difficult.

00:21:52.667 --> 00:21:53.543
Call a board meeting.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.797
Tell them the agenda is about
the CEO's dismissal.

00:21:58.631 --> 00:21:59.465
Yes, sir.

00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:01.217
As quickly as possible.

00:22:01.926 --> 00:22:04.512
Hey, Kang Pil-gu! Get it together!

00:22:04.595 --> 00:22:06.430
That jerk hit me first!

00:22:06.514 --> 00:22:07.849
It's not just me.

00:22:07.932 --> 00:22:10.893
He bullies and swears at other kids too.

00:22:11.435 --> 00:22:13.312
I was just trying to stop him

00:22:13.396 --> 00:22:15.022
from taking their money.

00:22:15.648 --> 00:22:16.941
Detective,

00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:19.026
why are you taking his word over mine?

00:22:19.694 --> 00:22:21.112
Cut.

00:22:23.072 --> 00:22:24.323
Let's take a ten-minute break.

00:22:25.283 --> 00:22:26.868
We'll take a ten-minute break.

00:22:29.704 --> 00:22:30.538
Let's go.

00:22:35.668 --> 00:22:37.712
You're doing another take, right?

00:22:37.795 --> 00:22:39.380
Will that improve his acting?

00:22:39.964 --> 00:22:42.175
I told you not to cast him!

00:22:43.467 --> 00:22:45.428
This won't work.

00:22:45.511 --> 00:22:47.263
Why don't you rehearse with him?

00:22:47.346 --> 00:22:48.556
-Me?
-Yes.

00:22:50.099 --> 00:22:51.350
-Seon-u.
-Yeah?

00:22:51.434 --> 00:22:52.476
You're doing well.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.270
-I am?
-Yeah, you are.

00:22:54.353 --> 00:22:55.771
But let's just…

00:22:55.855 --> 00:22:57.857
-Relax your muscles a bit.
-Relax?

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.400
-Yeah, and…
-Yeah?

00:22:59.483 --> 00:23:02.361
-Relax your muscles here.
-Okay.

00:23:02.445 --> 00:23:04.697
-And right here.
-Okay.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.657
You need to relax your hands too.

00:23:06.741 --> 00:23:07.992
-Okay, I got it.
-Good.

00:23:09.118 --> 00:23:10.411
Relax.

00:23:10.494 --> 00:23:11.704
Relax.

00:23:11.787 --> 00:23:14.165
Okay, now let's start over.

00:23:14.248 --> 00:23:15.791
All right, give it a try.

00:23:17.668 --> 00:23:19.795
"Hey, Kang Pil-gu. Get it together!"

00:23:19.879 --> 00:23:21.339
That jerk hit me first!

00:23:22.715 --> 00:23:25.343
-Seon-u, let's relax your muscles more.
-More?

00:23:25.426 --> 00:23:26.969
-Yes, right here.
-Okay.

00:23:27.053 --> 00:23:27.887
Action!

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.180
KEY DISTRIBUTOR HAN SEOK-HO & NETWORK

00:23:29.263 --> 00:23:31.515
This is our primary suspect,

00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:32.683
Han Seok-ho.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.688
On the surface,
he appears to run local clubs,

00:23:37.772 --> 00:23:38.856
but in reality,

00:23:40.358 --> 00:23:43.194
he's the key distributor
of a new synthetic drug called Nebula.

00:23:43.903 --> 00:23:45.363
He took control of the nightlife district

00:23:45.446 --> 00:23:47.073
-and illicit cash flows,
-Stay still.

00:23:47.156 --> 00:23:50.409
-and established a distribution network.
-Stay still.

00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:53.829
Our objective is clear.

00:23:54.705 --> 00:23:55.706
Han Seok-ho's--

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.334
-Cut!
-Cut!

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.544
Okay.

00:24:05.508 --> 00:24:07.093
Let's take a quick break.

00:24:07.718 --> 00:24:08.594
Thank you.

00:24:10.429 --> 00:24:11.764
What is it?

00:24:14.308 --> 00:24:15.142
Mr. Lim.

00:24:16.102 --> 00:24:20.231
This is the scene where
Pil-gu falls for RIU officer Gwon Se-na

00:24:20.314 --> 00:24:22.900
as she delivers a brilliant briefing.

00:24:23.526 --> 00:24:25.444
Is that how people act
when they fall for someone?

00:24:25.528 --> 00:24:26.445
You looked so distracted.

00:24:26.529 --> 00:24:28.239
I don't agree with you.

00:24:28.322 --> 00:24:31.867
Viewers these days
focus a lot on plausibility.

00:24:31.951 --> 00:24:35.621
Pil-gu only just gave up his crush
on the owner of the flower shop.

00:24:35.705 --> 00:24:38.249
But he falls for this woman
just because she's good at briefing?

00:24:38.332 --> 00:24:40.710
Pil-gu doesn't fall for just anyone.

00:24:40.793 --> 00:24:42.253
This is totally out of character!

00:24:42.336 --> 00:24:45.214
He gave up on the florist
because she was married with a kid!

00:24:45.298 --> 00:24:46.340
Why would he still be hung up on her?

00:24:46.424 --> 00:24:47.425
That's even weirder!

00:24:47.508 --> 00:24:48.426
You've never dated, have you?

00:24:50.219 --> 00:24:51.971
That's not how relationships work.

00:24:53.306 --> 00:24:54.181
Mr. Lim.

00:24:55.057 --> 00:24:57.977
You promised to do the romantic scenes
with Ms. Gwon Se-na.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.270
Should I play the recording?

00:25:02.189 --> 00:25:03.441
You jerk.

00:25:03.524 --> 00:25:05.401
We'll continue shooting, then.

00:25:06.444 --> 00:25:07.778
You know the next scene, right?

00:25:11.574 --> 00:25:13.451
It's too dangerous out in the field!

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.038
There are too many
crazy bastards out there!

00:25:17.997 --> 00:25:20.583
So just conduct the investigation,
and stay away from the scene.

00:25:24.628 --> 00:25:26.630
Are you worried about me?

00:25:28.132 --> 00:25:29.258
I wouldn't say that.

00:25:29.342 --> 00:25:30.593
Then what is it?

00:25:38.434 --> 00:25:40.603
Cut. Bad take. Let's go again.

00:25:40.686 --> 00:25:42.605
It's too dangerous out in the field!

00:25:42.688 --> 00:25:45.149
There are too many
crazy bastards out there!

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.903
So just conduct the investigation,
and stay away from the scene.

00:25:54.492 --> 00:25:56.160
Are you worried about me?

00:25:57.995 --> 00:25:59.372
I wouldn't say that.

00:25:59.955 --> 00:26:01.624
Then what is it?

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.426
Cut!

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:13.719
Bad take. Let's go again.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:17.306
Cut.

00:26:17.765 --> 00:26:18.599
Cut.

00:26:19.225 --> 00:26:20.059
Cut.

00:26:25.898 --> 00:26:27.358
-This is so annoying.
-Cut!

00:26:30.444 --> 00:26:31.445
It just came out.

00:26:32.655 --> 00:26:36.867
If you keep turning away like that,
we can't get a good shot.

00:26:37.576 --> 00:26:39.453
I didn't do it on purpose.

00:26:39.537 --> 00:26:40.955
Do you want to watch it together?

00:26:41.038 --> 00:26:43.582
No, there's no need for that. I'm fine.

00:26:43.666 --> 00:26:45.918
Pil-gu is supposed to
freeze in place as he's kissed.

00:26:46.001 --> 00:26:47.711
If you keep avoiding her,

00:26:47.795 --> 00:26:50.256
how is she supposed to kiss you?

00:26:50.798 --> 00:26:54.176
How about ending the scene
after she pushes me against the wall?

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.637
They're at work,
so they shouldn't take it too far.

00:26:58.431 --> 00:26:59.306
Okay, then.

00:27:01.183 --> 00:27:03.060
Then Ms. Gwon will just…

00:27:04.395 --> 00:27:06.730
She'll push you against the wall
and when she gets close--

00:27:06.814 --> 00:27:09.066
-Cut.
-Cut.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.484
I'll call cut.

00:27:12.153 --> 00:27:12.987
That's okay, right?

00:27:13.863 --> 00:27:15.406
Yes, that's fine.

00:27:15.489 --> 00:27:16.407
Okay.

00:27:25.082 --> 00:27:25.958
Man, another sneeze.

00:27:28.419 --> 00:27:28.457
NURI FOREST KINDERGARTEN

00:27:28.457 --> 00:27:31.172
NURI FOREST KINDERGARTEN

00:27:31.881 --> 00:27:33.215
Thanks for coming today.

00:27:35.259 --> 00:27:37.386
Why did you ask me, of all people?

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.723
My son asked me to bring a handsome uncle.

00:27:40.806 --> 00:27:44.268
But nobody else looked
as good to me as you did, Mr. Lee.

00:27:48.022 --> 00:27:48.981
Jeez.

00:27:56.572 --> 00:28:00.367
"I run because
I love your beautiful smile."

00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:04.663
"I run towards the school bus
that waits for us every morning."

00:28:07.082 --> 00:28:10.711
"I run as fast as I can
when I hear you're hurt."

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.428
"Even now, Mommy's still running."

00:28:20.012 --> 00:28:22.723
-"I'm running to get you."
-Hello.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.060
"Because I don't want to hurt your heart."

00:28:32.816 --> 00:28:33.651
Jae-ha.

00:28:34.235 --> 00:28:35.486
Mom!

00:28:35.569 --> 00:28:38.072
-"You just need to stay right there."
-I'm here, Jae-ha.

00:28:38.155 --> 00:28:39.156
Were you having fun?

00:28:39.698 --> 00:28:40.658
"And know that Mommy…"

00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:43.702
"…will always run to you."

00:28:57.466 --> 00:29:00.052
This part is the weirdest. Seriously.

00:29:01.303 --> 00:29:03.305
How much longer do I have to wait?

00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:04.848
When will we resume shooting?

00:29:04.932 --> 00:29:07.101
The lighting crew is still setting up.

00:29:08.143 --> 00:29:08.978
Yes?

00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:18.696
I'll go check the schedule.

00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:20.406
Hey, you can't leave.

00:29:24.743 --> 00:29:25.661
What is it?

00:29:27.413 --> 00:29:28.747
Are you going to keep this up?

00:29:29.331 --> 00:29:31.250
-What do you mean?
-Get it together.

00:29:31.333 --> 00:29:33.377
-What?
-You clearly have the wrong idea.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.588
Kang Pil-gu isn't just your show.

00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:38.549
Every project I take on
is important to me too.

00:29:38.632 --> 00:29:41.885
Our past is just between the two of us.

00:29:42.386 --> 00:29:45.347
How am I supposed to work with you
when you're being so childish?

00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:46.307
"Childish"?

00:29:46.974 --> 00:29:47.933
"Our past"?

00:29:49.268 --> 00:29:51.061
Wow, unbelievable.

00:29:51.145 --> 00:29:54.148
That's what you think of me?

00:29:54.231 --> 00:29:57.776
I'm frustrated because the plot
keeps going off track.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:01.322
Also, I don't need
your feedback on my acting.

00:30:02.114 --> 00:30:04.908
Based on the antics I saw,
I'd say you need some.

00:30:04.992 --> 00:30:05.993
"Antics"?

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.749
You said you still had
feelings for me, right?

00:30:14.084 --> 00:30:15.127
Yeah.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.086
There's someone

00:30:17.796 --> 00:30:18.797
I like.

00:30:20.674 --> 00:30:22.009
I'm seeing someone.

00:30:36.774 --> 00:30:38.609
Jeez, you've got to be kidding me.

00:30:38.692 --> 00:30:41.820
Are they going to
keep everyone waiting for hours?

00:30:41.904 --> 00:30:43.072
-Hey, Gil-su.
-Yes?

00:30:43.781 --> 00:30:45.699
Go ask when they'll resume shooting.

00:30:45.783 --> 00:30:48.118
I've already asked three times.

00:30:48.202 --> 00:30:49.703
They're not done prepping.

00:30:49.787 --> 00:30:51.121
What is there to prepare?

00:30:51.205 --> 00:30:53.248
He's revising the script
right now, isn't he?

00:30:54.124 --> 00:30:55.751
I told him from the start

00:30:55.834 --> 00:30:57.169
that dramas are different from movies,

00:30:57.252 --> 00:31:00.089
and that it'd be hard to direct and write
at the same time.

00:31:00.172 --> 00:31:01.757
I told him not to take on too much.

00:31:03.384 --> 00:31:04.468
Whatever.

00:31:05.386 --> 00:31:07.304
I'll just have to…

00:31:08.347 --> 00:31:09.223
I'll just…

00:31:09.973 --> 00:31:11.767
Grab our stuff. We're leaving.

00:31:15.396 --> 00:31:18.232
Wait, you're not really leaving, are you?

00:31:19.775 --> 00:31:20.984
-What?
-Is he leaving?

00:31:25.531 --> 00:31:26.573
LIM HYEON-JUN

00:31:32.371 --> 00:31:33.247
Did he really leave?

00:31:34.832 --> 00:31:35.749
Seriously?

00:31:47.261 --> 00:31:50.806
There are only a few of these cars
in the country, right?

00:31:52.266 --> 00:31:53.100
Probably.

00:31:56.311 --> 00:31:57.146
Bro.

00:31:57.938 --> 00:31:59.440
I haven't been in it yet either.

00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:01.525
Are you sure this is okay?

00:32:01.608 --> 00:32:04.570
I hear the whole set was in chaos
after you left.

00:32:04.653 --> 00:32:06.739
Is this really the time
to be rehearsing the script?

00:32:06.822 --> 00:32:08.824
I know what I'm doing.

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.702
Byeong-gi needs some time right now.

00:32:13.662 --> 00:32:14.663
You guys must be hungry.

00:32:15.873 --> 00:32:16.749
-Yeah.
-Yes.

00:32:16.832 --> 00:32:17.666
Okay.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.339
Can you hand me a paper towel?

00:32:24.923 --> 00:32:25.799
Yes, sir.

00:32:28.218 --> 00:32:29.636
POWER OUTAGE NOTICE

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.013
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

00:32:32.097 --> 00:32:34.308
Hyeon-jun just steamed
dumplings for us, right?

00:32:35.309 --> 00:32:36.310
Us?

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:39.354
Sure, let's say he did.

00:32:41.148 --> 00:32:44.443
Here you go, some delicious dumplings.

00:32:46.195 --> 00:32:48.614
I can't believe you personally steamed
dumplings for us.

00:32:49.948 --> 00:32:51.658
-There's plenty more, so dig in.
-Yes, sir.

00:32:51.742 --> 00:32:53.786
Thank you, Mr. Lim.

00:32:53.869 --> 00:32:54.953
Try it.

00:33:00.584 --> 00:33:01.418
It's so good.

00:33:02.753 --> 00:33:04.254
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:33:09.176 --> 00:33:10.177
It's really good!

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.136
Mr. Hwang, try some!

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.764
Gosh, stop exaggerating.

00:33:13.847 --> 00:33:15.849
All dumplings taste the same.

00:33:15.933 --> 00:33:17.351
"It's really good," my foot.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.357
The juices just explode in my mouth!

00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:28.237
Want to listen to something fun
while we eat?

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.823
You're not going to make Su-ji
tell a weird joke, are you?

00:33:32.491 --> 00:33:34.243
Su-ji? Do you mean the actress?

00:33:35.035 --> 00:33:36.119
-Hey, Su-ji.
-Yes?

00:33:36.203 --> 00:33:37.579
Tell us a funny joke.

00:33:37.663 --> 00:33:40.374
Okay. Here's the funny joke you requested.

00:33:40.457 --> 00:33:42.376
What do you call fast food that takes off?

00:33:44.878 --> 00:33:45.754
French fly!

00:33:52.886 --> 00:33:55.681
Did you hear that? She said "french fly."

00:34:01.395 --> 00:34:03.063
Right, "french fly."

00:34:03.146 --> 00:34:04.898
Don't laugh.
He'll think it's actually funny.

00:34:04.982 --> 00:34:05.899
Right, Mr…

00:34:07.776 --> 00:34:09.862
I thought she meant "fly," like this.

00:34:12.781 --> 00:34:14.449
"French fly" is so funny.

00:34:14.533 --> 00:34:17.202
Wow, that was absolutely hilarious.

00:34:17.286 --> 00:34:18.120
Mr. Lim.

00:34:19.121 --> 00:34:21.290
You invited me to rehearse the script

00:34:21.373 --> 00:34:24.126
and even steamed
delicious dumplings for me.

00:34:25.335 --> 00:34:28.171
-It's such an honor, sir.
-Come on.

00:34:28.255 --> 00:34:30.674
Honor? It's no big deal.

00:34:31.258 --> 00:34:32.467
Should I ask my sister

00:34:33.093 --> 00:34:35.888
to write a nice article about you?

00:34:36.763 --> 00:34:38.807
No, don't do that.

00:34:39.391 --> 00:34:41.685
I'm not the kind of guy
who asks for favors like that.

00:34:47.858 --> 00:34:48.901
By the way,

00:34:49.818 --> 00:34:50.903
does you sister know

00:34:52.112 --> 00:34:55.866
that you came over to my house today?

00:35:00.078 --> 00:35:04.416
KANG PIL-GU KISSES OR DOESN'T

00:35:04.499 --> 00:35:05.584
KISSES OR DOESN'TTTTTT

00:35:10.464 --> 00:35:12.174
I'll do whatever you write.

00:35:12.257 --> 00:35:15.218
I'll follow the script
if you do me this favor.

00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:33.654
KANG PIL-GU KISSES OR DOESN'T
KISSES OR DOESN'TTTTTT

00:35:33.737 --> 00:35:34.947
Mr. Lim.

00:35:40.369 --> 00:35:42.663
That color looks great on you.

00:35:42.746 --> 00:35:44.039
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:35:44.122 --> 00:35:46.792
-Hey, try this on, too.
-This too?

00:35:46.875 --> 00:35:49.503
-Yes, take off the shirt.
-That's too many already.

00:35:49.586 --> 00:35:51.296
Just try it on.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.881
But this is yours.

00:35:52.965 --> 00:35:54.341
Here we go.

00:35:54.967 --> 00:35:56.760
Hey, this fits you perfectly.

00:35:56.843 --> 00:35:58.178
It looks great.

00:35:58.804 --> 00:35:59.638
Take that too.

00:35:59.721 --> 00:36:01.932
Hyeon-jun,
he'll clean you out at this rate.

00:36:02.015 --> 00:36:03.183
Come on.

00:36:03.266 --> 00:36:07.104
It's for Hong-sin. Jeez.

00:36:07.187 --> 00:36:09.564
-Here, try on a suit.
-I really shouldn't…

00:36:10.649 --> 00:36:12.776
Hey, Mr. Lim really likes me.

00:36:13.443 --> 00:36:14.778
I know. What's wrong with him?

00:36:15.362 --> 00:36:16.488
There must be a reason for this.

00:36:16.571 --> 00:36:18.991
Right, so this one was expensive…

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.702
-Try this on.
-Yes, sir.

00:36:22.202 --> 00:36:23.286
-Hey, bro.
-What?

00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:24.663
How do I look?

00:36:25.789 --> 00:36:27.040
-Mr. Hwang.
-Huh?

00:36:27.124 --> 00:36:29.459
Leopard print and CEO don't mix.

00:36:30.919 --> 00:36:32.379
Put it back before I kick you out.

00:36:37.509 --> 00:36:38.927
-Here.
-Yes, sir.

00:36:42.305 --> 00:36:45.017
This script reading room
is bigger than my house.

00:36:45.726 --> 00:36:47.185
Watching Kang Pil-gu here
will blow your mind.

00:36:47.269 --> 00:36:48.854
Bro, this is new.

00:36:48.937 --> 00:36:50.188
Yeah, go ahead and try it out.

00:36:51.064 --> 00:36:54.026
-It's about time you got this.
-These are expensive speakers.

00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:55.527
-Wow, this feels great.
-This is crazy.

00:36:56.153 --> 00:36:57.237
Man, this is awesome.

00:37:00.532 --> 00:37:01.950
You like season four, right?

00:37:04.703 --> 00:37:05.620
He has them all.

00:37:08.373 --> 00:37:11.001
"A cop? How can someone like me
become a cop?"

00:37:11.084 --> 00:37:13.003
"What do you mean by that?"

00:37:13.086 --> 00:37:14.463
"You know what I mean."

00:37:14.546 --> 00:37:17.883
"Without you, I'd have been expelled
and out there hurting people."

00:37:17.966 --> 00:37:19.051
"So how can I be a cop?"

00:37:19.718 --> 00:37:20.844
What do you think?

00:37:25.307 --> 00:37:27.768
That was good. Nicely done.

00:37:27.851 --> 00:37:29.227
You did a good job.

00:37:29.811 --> 00:37:30.645
But first,

00:37:30.729 --> 00:37:33.398
you need to connect with your character.

00:37:33.482 --> 00:37:37.402
After that, you need to connect
with your partner's character.

00:37:37.486 --> 00:37:39.946
Once those connections are established,

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:43.116
that's when the audience
will empathize with your performance.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.242
-Got it?
-I see.

00:37:44.785 --> 00:37:47.079
So for now,
you need to connect with each other.

00:37:47.162 --> 00:37:48.705
Got it? Connecting.

00:37:48.789 --> 00:37:49.998
"Connecting."

00:37:50.082 --> 00:37:51.416
ACTING IS ABOUT CONNECTING AND EMPATHIZING

00:37:53.794 --> 00:37:57.672
So because no one would cast him,

00:37:57.756 --> 00:38:02.344
he wrote his own screenplay
and starred in it.

00:38:02.427 --> 00:38:03.345
-Wow.
-I see.

00:38:03.428 --> 00:38:04.971
And that's how Rocky was born.

00:38:06.556 --> 00:38:08.892
Isn't that more moving
than the movie itself?

00:38:08.975 --> 00:38:10.143
Yes, it is.

00:38:10.227 --> 00:38:11.603
The moral of the story is,

00:38:11.686 --> 00:38:13.563
if you want to achieve something,

00:38:13.647 --> 00:38:16.358
don't stop until you get it.

00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:17.609
Just like Rocky did.

00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.986
Cheers.

00:38:20.737 --> 00:38:22.322
You're right.

00:38:22.405 --> 00:38:23.698
You're so right, Mr. Lim.

00:38:28.203 --> 00:38:30.914
You're such a handsome
and amazing man, Mr. Lim.

00:38:30.997 --> 00:38:34.459
How did I set you up on a blind date
with someone like my sister?

00:38:34.543 --> 00:38:35.669
I'm so greatly

00:38:36.419 --> 00:38:37.838
sorry about that.

00:38:38.421 --> 00:38:39.297
Huh?

00:38:40.674 --> 00:38:41.758
A blind date?

00:38:41.842 --> 00:38:47.973
She went to Hankuk University
and works as a reporter.

00:38:55.772 --> 00:38:56.857
I like you.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.275
Excuse me?

00:38:59.693 --> 00:39:00.944
I like you.

00:39:03.238 --> 00:39:04.072
I like you.

00:39:04.156 --> 00:39:05.073
Stop.

00:39:06.199 --> 00:39:08.076
Stop. Be quiet.

00:39:12.914 --> 00:39:14.040
Listen.

00:39:16.126 --> 00:39:17.002
Listen, I…

00:39:17.586 --> 00:39:18.420
Just shut up!

00:39:22.674 --> 00:39:24.050
I like

00:39:24.134 --> 00:39:25.802
Wi Jeong-sin.

00:39:27.345 --> 00:39:29.306
I like Wi Jeong-sin!

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.349
Me!

00:39:31.433 --> 00:39:32.350
Huh?

00:39:32.851 --> 00:39:33.894
Excuse me?

00:39:35.103 --> 00:39:36.813
Whatever, I give up.

00:39:37.689 --> 00:39:40.984
Mr. Lim, did you just say

00:39:41.776 --> 00:39:43.320
that you like my sister?

00:39:44.654 --> 00:39:45.739
Yeah.

00:39:45.822 --> 00:39:46.948
Dad!

00:39:47.032 --> 00:39:48.742
Yes, my son?

00:39:48.825 --> 00:39:50.202
Why did you call me?

00:39:50.285 --> 00:39:51.620
-What do you need?
-Ask him for the soup.

00:39:51.703 --> 00:39:53.705
-Oh, you want the rice cake soup?
-Here it comes.

00:39:53.788 --> 00:39:56.791
Eat some rice cake soup, son.

00:39:56.875 --> 00:39:59.127
-I'm here, Hyeon-jun!
-Come on in!

00:39:59.794 --> 00:40:01.546
-Good to see you, brother-in-law.
-Hey.

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:03.506
Come on and have a seat.

00:40:04.049 --> 00:40:05.508
See this galbi?

00:40:05.592 --> 00:40:10.430
-Wow.
-Your sister spent all night making this.

00:40:10.513 --> 00:40:12.265
-Eat up.
-Go ahead and dig in.

00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:13.225
Hey!

00:40:14.476 --> 00:40:16.019
Aren't you guys
getting ahead of yourselves?

00:40:19.314 --> 00:40:20.315
Maybe we are.

00:40:20.857 --> 00:40:21.816
Hey.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.112
Could you do me a favor?

00:40:31.618 --> 00:40:33.203
MY LITTLE BROTHER

00:40:34.412 --> 00:40:36.289
Why are you calling me?
You should be home!

00:40:36.373 --> 00:40:37.916
WI JEONG-SIN

00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:40.168
Jeong-sin, I'm in pain.

00:40:40.252 --> 00:40:41.253
What?

00:40:42.212 --> 00:40:43.171
Is this a phone scam?

00:40:45.465 --> 00:40:46.383
What's your clan origin?

00:40:46.466 --> 00:40:47.884
The Jangheung Wi clan.

00:40:47.968 --> 00:40:50.345
Go to a hospital if you're sick.
Why are you asking me to pick you up?

00:40:50.428 --> 00:40:51.680
Oh, I…

00:40:51.763 --> 00:40:55.475
Everyone's been drinking,
so no one can drive.

00:40:55.558 --> 00:40:57.143
Then take a damn taxi!

00:40:57.227 --> 00:40:59.646
Don't get so worked up.
You'll hurt your image.

00:40:59.729 --> 00:41:01.189
What are you talking about?

00:41:01.273 --> 00:41:03.149
Anyway, Jeong-sin,

00:41:04.025 --> 00:41:08.488
I twisted my ankle so badly
that it hurts too much to get a taxi.

00:41:08.571 --> 00:41:11.074
I can't move at all.

00:41:11.157 --> 00:41:13.576
Damn it, you're so annoying.
Where are you?

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.787
At Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun's house.

00:41:17.497 --> 00:41:18.665
What?

00:41:19.249 --> 00:41:20.125
I'm home.

00:41:20.625 --> 00:41:21.626
You're just getting in?

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:22.585
What were you doing?

00:41:24.004 --> 00:41:25.380
I was looking through your photo album.

00:41:25.463 --> 00:41:26.923
That's out of the blue.

00:41:27.632 --> 00:41:29.676
You were so adorable back then.

00:41:31.011 --> 00:41:32.429
Nice, you got grapes.

00:41:33.221 --> 00:41:36.850
When you were little,
people used to say you looked like a doll.

00:41:37.642 --> 00:41:39.102
-Jeez.
-Look at this.

00:41:39.185 --> 00:41:40.895
-Look how cute you were.
-Wow.

00:41:40.979 --> 00:41:42.147
How old was I?

00:41:49.446 --> 00:41:50.322
Jae-ha!

00:41:50.864 --> 00:41:52.365
Mom!

00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:54.868
My precious son.

00:41:57.037 --> 00:41:59.372
I brought an uncle. Say hello.

00:41:59.456 --> 00:42:00.665
Hello.

00:42:01.333 --> 00:42:02.250
Hello.

00:42:18.183 --> 00:42:19.642
How badly is he hurt?

00:42:21.394 --> 00:42:23.146
It's not bad, really.

00:42:24.522 --> 00:42:25.357
Come in.

00:42:36.368 --> 00:42:38.119
Did he even hurt his ankle?

00:42:39.245 --> 00:42:42.082
No, he's not hurt.

00:42:42.165 --> 00:42:45.043
We were rehearsing the script
when we got thirsty

00:42:45.126 --> 00:42:47.337
and decided to have a beer.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.632
I guess everyone was really tired
and they all crashed.

00:42:51.674 --> 00:42:52.592
Well…

00:42:53.176 --> 00:42:54.886
I'll wake up your brother,

00:42:54.969 --> 00:42:57.055
so just rest in the study downstairs.

00:42:57.639 --> 00:42:58.932
Or try out the massage chair.

00:43:25.959 --> 00:43:30.588
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:43:51.776 --> 00:43:53.361
Starting the massage chair.

00:44:05.498 --> 00:44:07.625
Adjusting the massage chair position.

00:44:10.253 --> 00:44:11.463
Oh, that feels great.

00:44:11.963 --> 00:44:13.214
This is nice.

00:44:15.133 --> 00:44:16.092
It's great, right?

00:44:18.887 --> 00:44:20.054
Just stay there.

00:44:20.138 --> 00:44:21.473
No, give me the remote.

00:44:21.556 --> 00:44:23.349
Just stay there longer.

00:44:23.433 --> 00:44:26.144
Hong-sin isn't awake yet,
so we have to wait anyway.

00:44:28.271 --> 00:44:29.105
Well…

00:44:32.984 --> 00:44:33.985
Thank you for that day.

00:44:35.612 --> 00:44:36.613
When I had a panic attack.

00:44:37.572 --> 00:44:40.408
I realized I never
properly thanked you that day.

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:42.660
I didn't really do anything.

00:44:45.872 --> 00:44:47.749
Can you turn this off?
I'll wake Hong-sin up.

00:44:48.666 --> 00:44:50.126
I said it was okay.

00:44:51.419 --> 00:44:53.171
What the heck? Why did the lights go out?

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:55.507
-Did the power go out?
-I guess so.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:58.218
What am I supposed to do? I'm stuck!

00:44:58.301 --> 00:44:59.761
I'm done with the massage!

00:45:00.345 --> 00:45:01.513
Come on, do something!

00:45:01.596 --> 00:45:04.349
Just wait a little bit.
It'll come back on soon.

00:45:04.432 --> 00:45:05.767
How long will it take?

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.393
Just relax.

00:45:10.563 --> 00:45:12.023
And listen to what I have to say.

00:45:13.107 --> 00:45:16.402
Did you listen to your heart
and really think about it?

00:45:17.487 --> 00:45:18.696
Well, I…

00:45:23.117 --> 00:45:24.744
That's disappointing.

00:45:24.827 --> 00:45:26.412
I called you over to tell you

00:45:27.038 --> 00:45:29.123
that I like you.

00:45:31.209 --> 00:45:32.335
I like you.

00:45:43.846 --> 00:45:45.974
I haven't liked anyone
for a very long time.

00:45:47.267 --> 00:45:48.142
But…

00:45:50.228 --> 00:45:51.896
I have a feeling I'll like you…

00:45:54.607 --> 00:45:55.858
for a long time to come.

00:46:25.096 --> 00:46:27.390
Jeez, where are my car keys?

00:46:28.516 --> 00:46:29.934
Hey, have you seen my phone?

00:46:30.018 --> 00:46:33.062
I saw your phone upstairs.

00:46:45.325 --> 00:46:46.451
Damn.

00:46:46.534 --> 00:46:48.244
I didn't need to see that.

00:46:48.828 --> 00:46:49.746
Spit it out, guys.

00:46:51.289 --> 00:46:53.249
I can't believe
I caught my sister getting all romantic.

00:46:53.916 --> 00:46:56.794
-Gross!
-We might end up being in-laws after all.

00:46:56.878 --> 00:46:58.421
I just got chills!

00:46:58.504 --> 00:47:00.381
This won't do. We need to pray.

00:47:00.465 --> 00:47:02.550
Please help us forget
everything we saw today.

00:47:02.634 --> 00:47:04.135
-Please help us forget.
-Please help us forget.

00:47:04.218 --> 00:47:06.054
-Amen.
-Amen.

00:47:06.804 --> 00:47:09.057
Gosh, it feels awkward
now that the lights are on.

00:47:09.641 --> 00:47:10.850
-Shall I turn them off again?
-No!

00:47:19.192 --> 00:47:20.818
Just go on ten dates with me.

00:47:25.782 --> 00:47:26.741
Why ten dates?

00:47:26.824 --> 00:47:28.826
You don't seem to trust me,

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:30.870
so let's go on ten dates for now.

00:47:30.953 --> 00:47:32.538
If that goes well,
we'll keep seeing each other.

00:47:33.998 --> 00:47:36.626
-And what if it doesn't?
-Why are you being so negative?

00:47:36.709 --> 00:47:38.586
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

00:47:41.381 --> 00:47:43.633
I have a question.

00:47:46.302 --> 00:47:47.387
When we talked on Onion,

00:47:48.638 --> 00:47:51.391
what did you think of Soulishere?

00:47:51.474 --> 00:47:53.476
-I liked her, of course.
-Then why did you delete your account?

00:47:54.602 --> 00:47:56.521
So I could focus on Wi Jeong-sin.

00:48:01.442 --> 00:48:02.276
Right!

00:48:03.277 --> 00:48:04.112
I understand.

00:48:04.904 --> 00:48:05.905
If you'll excuse me,

00:48:06.781 --> 00:48:07.615
I have to go now.

00:48:11.994 --> 00:48:13.246
Wi Hong-sin, I'm leaving!

00:48:24.674 --> 00:48:26.926
Look at you. Were you that nervous?

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:30.304
-Everyone, Wi Jeong-sin got confessed to!
-Hey!

00:48:30.388 --> 00:48:31.806
Why did you accept all of that?

00:48:31.889 --> 00:48:33.599
He was offering them,
and I couldn't refuse.

00:48:35.017 --> 00:48:36.144
Anyway,

00:48:36.227 --> 00:48:38.813
you two were like enemies,
so when did you become…

00:48:38.896 --> 00:48:40.565
There's that fist again.

00:48:40.648 --> 00:48:42.024
-Get away from me!
-You're so dead!

00:48:50.658 --> 00:48:51.492
I like you.

00:48:52.702 --> 00:48:55.621
I have a feeling I'll like you
for a long time to come.

00:48:59.375 --> 00:49:00.543
When we talked on Onion,

00:49:00.626 --> 00:49:03.337
what did you think about Soulishere?

00:49:03.421 --> 00:49:05.882
-I liked her, of course.
-Then why did you delete your account?

00:49:05.965 --> 00:49:08.050
So I could focus on Wi Jeong-sin.

00:49:18.603 --> 00:49:19.562
Calm down.

00:49:20.396 --> 00:49:22.398
Just calm down.

00:49:25.067 --> 00:49:26.152
Forget about it.

00:49:28.946 --> 00:49:29.781
I like you.

00:49:30.406 --> 00:49:31.407
I'll like you

00:49:32.074 --> 00:49:33.409
for a long time to come.

00:49:35.077 --> 00:49:36.621
Just go on ten dates with me.

00:49:36.704 --> 00:49:37.538
Onion!

00:49:44.253 --> 00:49:45.171
Soulishere.

00:49:45.254 --> 00:49:46.297
You can't sleep, can you?

00:49:48.382 --> 00:49:50.676
Why did you run away like that earlier?

00:49:53.221 --> 00:49:54.180
I felt shy.

00:49:56.349 --> 00:49:58.476
Wi Jeong-sin, feeling shy?

00:49:59.894 --> 00:50:01.103
I'm human too, you know.

00:50:01.187 --> 00:50:04.774
Now that I think about it,
you have a rather unusual taste too.

00:50:05.566 --> 00:50:06.526
What about it?

00:50:06.609 --> 00:50:09.362
Only a handful of people
get along with me.

00:50:09.445 --> 00:50:11.656
Come on, who says we get along?

00:50:12.281 --> 00:50:16.410
I'm just a man with a big heart

00:50:16.494 --> 00:50:18.412
who can handle being with you.

00:50:18.955 --> 00:50:22.500
It's your good luck
to have met someone like me.

00:50:27.463 --> 00:50:28.297
I see.

00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:30.007
Lucky me.

00:50:33.302 --> 00:50:34.929
How are you with your anxiety?

00:50:35.888 --> 00:50:36.806
It's better.

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:39.559
Weirdly enough,
I've been feeling good these days.

00:50:40.852 --> 00:50:42.019
I think it's thanks to someone.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:51.320
I've been the man of the house
since I was young, so I get it.

00:50:51.404 --> 00:50:53.948
Sometimes, my family makes life harder
than anyone else.

00:50:56.033 --> 00:50:58.536
What do you do
when life gets hard, Mr. Lim?

00:51:01.622 --> 00:51:04.208
I just bear through it.

00:51:04.292 --> 00:51:05.918
Then after a while,

00:51:06.002 --> 00:51:09.088
I realize, "Oh, I got through it."

00:51:09.171 --> 00:51:12.633
"It passes, just like it always does."

00:51:12.717 --> 00:51:14.385
From now on, when life gets hard,

00:51:14.468 --> 00:51:16.470
I'm going to sit outside in the sun.

00:51:17.054 --> 00:51:18.639
Like the way you taught me, Soulishere.

00:51:21.183 --> 00:51:24.520
By the way,
why did you message me on Onion?

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:30.484
You obviously weren't over Melomaster,

00:51:30.568 --> 00:51:32.445
so I thought I'd surprise you.

00:51:33.029 --> 00:51:34.989
I even changed my nickname, you know.

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:39.285
I have a question too.

00:51:39.368 --> 00:51:40.536
What is it?

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.996
I've been curious.

00:51:42.079 --> 00:51:44.081
When I apologized to you that day
at Hangang River,

00:51:44.165 --> 00:51:46.334
why didn't you accept it?

00:51:49.921 --> 00:51:51.339
If I accepted your apology,

00:51:52.715 --> 00:51:55.801
I knew I'd expect more of you,
so I kept my guard up.

00:51:58.137 --> 00:51:59.931
You pretended you weren't,

00:52:00.514 --> 00:52:02.767
but you're totally into me.

00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:05.144
No, I'm not.

00:52:07.313 --> 00:52:08.189
Seriously.

00:52:45.518 --> 00:52:46.644
TUESDAY, JULY 1ST

00:53:03.411 --> 00:53:05.705
-The documents you requested.
-Thank you.

00:53:22.763 --> 00:53:23.597
Bro!

00:53:24.849 --> 00:53:25.850
Where is he?

00:53:27.518 --> 00:53:28.519
You're still asleep?

00:53:29.437 --> 00:53:30.271
Are you insane?

00:53:30.855 --> 00:53:32.023
Get up!

00:53:32.106 --> 00:53:35.067
Do you know what time it is?
We have to be there by 6 p.m.!

00:53:35.151 --> 00:53:37.069
We're in so much trouble.

00:53:37.153 --> 00:53:39.697
It'll take over three hours to get there
because of rush hour traffic!

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.032
Hurry up and get up!

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:44.618
-The shoot.
-Yes, the shoot!

00:53:44.702 --> 00:53:46.662
Jeez, I've lost my mind.

00:53:46.746 --> 00:53:49.123
-Oh, man.
-There's no time to wash up.

00:53:49.206 --> 00:53:50.833
-Hold on.
-What is it?

00:53:51.917 --> 00:53:52.960
My phone.

00:53:54.128 --> 00:53:56.297
-My phone.
-That damn phone.

00:53:57.673 --> 00:53:58.841
What did you just say?

00:53:58.924 --> 00:54:02.178
Chairman Lee Dae-ho hired someone
to orchestrate Lee Jae-hyeong's accident.

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:05.056
Back when I was at the US branch
of a business newspaper,

00:54:05.139 --> 00:54:07.224
I was covering the Lemon incident.

00:54:07.808 --> 00:54:09.810
I had proof that Lee Dae-ho was behind it,

00:54:09.894 --> 00:54:12.146
and my article was almost finished.

00:54:12.229 --> 00:54:13.064
That's when…

00:54:14.815 --> 00:54:17.234
President Lee Jae-hyeong
got into a car accident.

00:54:19.153 --> 00:54:20.321
I know it was him.

00:54:23.324 --> 00:54:24.492
Chairman Lee Dae-ho

00:54:25.451 --> 00:54:27.536
is even worse than I thought.

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.580
How could he do that
to his younger brother?

00:54:34.001 --> 00:54:36.420
Here's everything I gathered
on the Lemon incident.

00:54:36.504 --> 00:54:37.963
Including this information

00:54:38.839 --> 00:54:40.716
will turn the case huge.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:41.675
Are you sure about this?

00:54:46.806 --> 00:54:48.015
If we want this to blow up,

00:54:48.891 --> 00:54:50.559
it needs to be big.

00:54:50.643 --> 00:54:52.561
That's the only way to make serious noise.

00:55:14.208 --> 00:55:16.836
Let me say this again. You could get hurt.

00:55:16.919 --> 00:55:17.837
Or maybe even

00:55:18.838 --> 00:55:20.548
someone close to you.

00:55:20.631 --> 00:55:22.133
If you're not ready for that,

00:55:23.008 --> 00:55:24.009
it'd be better not to look.

00:55:31.308 --> 00:55:33.060
CHAIRMAN LEE DAE-HO RECORDS,
LEMON FUND MANAGEMENT

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:37.648
Gil-su, can you step on it?

00:55:37.731 --> 00:55:38.649
Sure.

00:55:38.732 --> 00:55:41.735
Yeah, Director Bak will complain again.

00:55:41.819 --> 00:55:43.988
What kept you up all night?

00:55:44.071 --> 00:55:46.991
-Is your insomnia acting up again?
-It's not like that.

00:55:51.912 --> 00:55:53.998
Did you just laugh?

00:55:54.957 --> 00:55:55.791
No, I didn't.

00:55:55.875 --> 00:55:57.209
Let's step on it!

00:55:57.293 --> 00:55:58.460
-Okay.
-Yeah, let's hurry.

00:56:15.436 --> 00:56:16.270
One of them

00:56:16.353 --> 00:56:20.107
covered the aide's suicide case
when you were an assemblyman.

00:56:20.191 --> 00:56:22.776
The other one covered the Lemon incident.

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:25.404
And now, the two of them have joined hands

00:56:26.614 --> 00:56:27.907
to hound both of us.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.409
What should we do about this?

00:56:30.492 --> 00:56:33.662
It'd be best to take care of it
like last time, right?

00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.437
-Grab our stuff and meet us inside.
-Okay.

00:56:59.438 --> 00:57:01.106
-Damn it.
-We're in big trouble.

00:57:01.815 --> 00:57:03.776
-What is it?
-What's wrong with this?

00:57:03.859 --> 00:57:05.194
Hey, the door is locked.

00:57:06.362 --> 00:57:07.363
-What?
-What the heck?

00:57:07.863 --> 00:57:08.781
It's locked.

00:57:09.698 --> 00:57:11.867
Wait, this is Building G.

00:57:11.951 --> 00:57:14.912
-We're supposed to go to Building H.
-Come on, Gil-su.

00:57:14.995 --> 00:57:15.829
Bro, get in.

00:57:15.913 --> 00:57:18.207
Go ahead and park the car.
I'll walk over there.

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:20.167
Okay, I'll grab our stuff
and meet you there.

00:57:20.251 --> 00:57:21.752
Hey, hurry up and go.

00:57:21.835 --> 00:57:23.212
Jeez.

00:58:04.586 --> 00:58:05.587
What's going on?

00:58:10.718 --> 00:58:11.927
Is it a crew member?

00:58:55.471 --> 00:58:56.847
Let me say this again.

00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:58.807
You could get hurt.

00:58:58.891 --> 00:58:59.975
Or maybe even

00:59:00.476 --> 00:59:02.061
someone close to you.

00:59:36.804 --> 00:59:38.597
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

00:59:41.517 --> 00:59:43.685
Chairman Lee Dae-ho is a ruthless man.

00:59:43.769 --> 00:59:45.229
I'm sure he planned it all from the start.

00:59:45.312 --> 00:59:46.438
Fired?

00:59:46.522 --> 00:59:47.481
Why would you get fired?

00:59:47.564 --> 00:59:50.859
Ms. Wi, I desperately need
your help right now.

00:59:50.943 --> 00:59:51.985
If we're going to strike back,

00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:53.570
-we need evidence first.
-Move aside!

00:59:53.654 --> 00:59:55.239
They wouldn't let us in.

00:59:55.322 --> 00:59:57.074
Ms. Wi's clothes got ripped.

00:59:57.157 --> 00:59:58.659
Her clothes got ripped?

00:59:58.742 --> 01:00:01.120
Those bastards won't get away with this.

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.080
Damn it, get out of the way!

01:00:03.163 --> 01:00:04.039
Ms. Wi!

01:00:04.123 --> 01:00:07.584
I'm not the type
to take crap from anyone, either.

01:00:12.714 --> 01:00:14.716
