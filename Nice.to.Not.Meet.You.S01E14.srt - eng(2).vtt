00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:52.933
You've been curious, haven't you?

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:53.033
You've been curious, haven't you?

00:00:53.784 --> 00:00:57.288
About why I left the US
so suddenly back then.

00:00:59.373 --> 00:01:00.666
I'm going back to Korea.

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:03.502
I'm sorry that I'm leaving
when you're like this.

00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:05.337
Forget about everything
and focus on your treatment.

00:01:14.054 --> 00:01:15.306
You're finally going to explain?

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.978
It's a long story
and worse than you could ever imagine.

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:23.355
So prepare yourself
for what I'm about to tell you.

00:01:24.857 --> 00:01:25.941
Seven years ago,

00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:29.194
I discovered that a US fund company
backed by a Korean asset management firm

00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:31.864
was having financial troubles.

00:01:32.448 --> 00:01:34.700
And one of its top investors

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:36.660
was your brother.

00:01:36.744 --> 00:01:37.578
My brother?

00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:39.538
Yes,

00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:41.415
your brother.

00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:43.626
Chairman Lee Dae-ho.

00:01:45.628 --> 00:01:48.047
When he found out
I was investigating the firm,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.506
he showed up and threatened me.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.425
And early that morning…

00:01:53.594 --> 00:01:55.471
you got into that accident.

00:01:57.222 --> 00:01:59.642
Are you suggesting that the person
who caused the accident…

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:00.768
It was your brother.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.648
I was scared.

00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:07.232
If I wrote the article,

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:10.694
I felt he might actually kill you
when you barely survived the accident.

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:13.072
That's why I left you.

00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:16.575
Your brother

00:02:17.493 --> 00:02:19.620
has done far too many terrible things.

00:02:19.703 --> 00:02:21.163
He even harmed people.

00:02:22.498 --> 00:02:23.540
I'm sorry, but…

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.544
I can't hear any more of this.

00:03:14.341 --> 00:03:15.426
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin.

00:03:17.177 --> 00:03:18.095
We've met before.

00:03:19.138 --> 00:03:22.850
You've ignored my meeting requests,
but here you are now.

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:25.394
I only respond to requests
from those at a level worthy of my time.

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:27.271
But you keep crossing the line,

00:03:27.354 --> 00:03:30.274
so I had to take precious time
out of my schedule for this.

00:03:30.357 --> 00:03:31.734
Why aren't you firing me?

00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:34.486
Fire you?

00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:39.033
If this problem were that simple,
I wouldn't have had to step in.

00:03:40.242 --> 00:03:42.411
I either make people give up

00:03:43.037 --> 00:03:44.705
or simply eliminate them.

00:03:44.788 --> 00:03:45.831
That's how I do things.

00:03:45.914 --> 00:03:47.124
Is that a threat?

00:03:47.207 --> 00:03:48.125
It's advice.

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:51.545
Consider it advice
given out of concern for you.

00:03:54.381 --> 00:03:57.217
There must be numbers of people
you simply eliminated.

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.267
I suggest you stop
what you're doing right now.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.603
It won't end well for you if you continue.

00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:15.027
You're wasting your time.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.111
I won't give up.

00:04:19.198 --> 00:04:20.157
Fine, then.

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:25.913
Now that I know where you stand,

00:04:27.122 --> 00:04:29.374
I'll have to take matters
into my own hands.

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:16.255
What a crazy bastard!

00:05:17.673 --> 00:05:18.549
Damn.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.620
Are you sure you can handle it?

00:06:17.608 --> 00:06:18.984
EPISODE 14

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.368
Wi Jeong-sin is the only person
who can stop your brother.

00:06:29.203 --> 00:06:32.664
So I need your help
getting her article published,

00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:36.752
in Sports Eunseong.

00:06:37.794 --> 00:06:38.670
Please.

00:06:45.594 --> 00:06:46.428
Huh?

00:06:48.472 --> 00:06:50.015
Hey, this door is locked too!

00:06:50.098 --> 00:06:50.933
What?

00:06:51.683 --> 00:06:53.227
Are you sure you got the right schedule?

00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:55.187
Call the assistant director.

00:06:56.438 --> 00:06:58.273
We're supposed to be on set by 6:30 p.m.

00:06:59.733 --> 00:07:01.944
The person you are trying to reach…

00:07:02.027 --> 00:07:02.945
He's not answering.

00:07:06.031 --> 00:07:07.574
What the hell is going on?

00:07:22.506 --> 00:07:24.132
Hello? Yeah.

00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:28.512
Really?

00:07:29.972 --> 00:07:31.682
All right. Thanks, Gil-su.

00:07:31.765 --> 00:07:32.683
Head home.

00:07:32.766 --> 00:07:34.059
-What did he say?
-Oh.

00:07:35.435 --> 00:07:36.561
Well…

00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:39.022
He went to the production office
and knocked,

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:39.940
but no one was there.

00:07:40.023 --> 00:07:42.651
And all the lights were off
in the director's studio.

00:07:42.734 --> 00:07:44.236
You've got to be kidding me.

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:45.821
They're unbelievable.

00:07:45.904 --> 00:07:46.863
Those jerks!

00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:49.074
Hey, Hyeon-jun.

00:07:49.157 --> 00:07:50.659
Let's calm down.

00:07:50.742 --> 00:07:52.452
How can I calm down?

00:07:52.953 --> 00:07:56.999
He begged me to take this role, so I did!

00:07:57.082 --> 00:07:59.835
And now the director himself
gangs up with the crew to ostracize me?

00:08:00.377 --> 00:08:03.005
Mr. Hwang, go tell Byeong-gi and Mr. Son

00:08:03.088 --> 00:08:05.340
that I'm not filming
until I get an apology!

00:08:05.424 --> 00:08:06.383
Come on, bro.

00:08:06.466 --> 00:08:07.551
Go tell them right now!

00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:18.562
Man, how am I supposed to tell them
when there's nobody there?

00:08:34.202 --> 00:08:35.370
Huh?

00:08:35.454 --> 00:08:38.040
And all the lights were off
in the director's studio.

00:09:15.035 --> 00:09:17.245
Gosh, how many years has it been?

00:09:18.455 --> 00:09:20.290
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU

00:09:22.042 --> 00:09:25.170
Hello, my precious trophy.
It's been a while.

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:27.381
How have you been?

00:09:27.464 --> 00:09:29.633
Ready. Action!

00:09:30.425 --> 00:09:31.259
Cut!

00:09:31.343 --> 00:09:32.219
-Don't stop.
-Action!

00:09:32.302 --> 00:09:35.097
-Keep acting until I say cut.
-Action!

00:09:35.597 --> 00:09:37.516
Mr. Lim, let's go again.

00:09:38.058 --> 00:09:39.267
Cut!

00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:40.394
Cut!

00:09:40.477 --> 00:09:42.813
-Cut!
-It's not like you've worked with

00:09:42.896 --> 00:09:44.189
those directors either, Mr. Lim.

00:09:44.272 --> 00:09:45.565
Action!

00:09:46.608 --> 00:09:48.193
-What?
-Cut. Again.

00:09:49.194 --> 00:09:51.113
They say you can't fix people.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.156
But…

00:09:54.032 --> 00:09:55.367
I do.

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:57.744
Cut! Okay!

00:09:57.828 --> 00:09:59.788
-We're done!
-Yes!

00:09:59.871 --> 00:10:01.623
I aim to be a director who never forgets

00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:03.750
the original spark that inspired me.

00:10:07.087 --> 00:10:10.382
It must've been suffocating
sitting in this dark box for so long.

00:10:14.136 --> 00:10:16.304
Wow, I can't believe
I held on to all of this.

00:10:24.062 --> 00:10:26.189
Yes, let's kill Kang Pil-gu!

00:10:26.273 --> 00:10:27.732
I get into a huge accident.

00:10:27.816 --> 00:10:29.985
So I undergo a face swap
and come out completely transformed.

00:10:30.068 --> 00:10:33.238
That way, another actor
can take over as Kang Pil-gu.

00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:36.867
How about ending the scene
after she pushes me against the wall?

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.202
They're at work,
so they shouldn't take it too far.

00:10:39.286 --> 00:10:42.831
Could you revise the part
about Kang Pil-gu becoming corrupt

00:10:42.914 --> 00:10:45.834
just a tiny bit?

00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:48.378
A writer's job is to
make sense of such things.

00:10:54.176 --> 00:10:55.260
Did he really leave?

00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:08.440
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

00:11:08.523 --> 00:11:10.442
Director Bak, you can't do this!

00:11:10.525 --> 00:11:12.402
Have you forgotten
everything we talked about?

00:11:12.486 --> 00:11:14.237
-Be quiet.
-Come on, Director Bak.

00:11:14.321 --> 00:11:16.031
-Just shut up.
-We'll be ruined!

00:11:16.615 --> 00:11:18.116
It's me, Kang Pil-gu.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.326
Listen to me.

00:11:19.409 --> 00:11:20.911
This will ruin everything!

00:11:20.994 --> 00:11:23.205
You can't do this!

00:11:23.288 --> 00:11:26.500
Yes, I can.

00:11:29.503 --> 00:11:29.542
What's the matter with Mr. Lim these days?

00:11:29.542 --> 00:11:31.046
What's the matter with Mr. Lim these days?

00:11:31.129 --> 00:11:32.881
He doesn't know his lines
or rehearse his stunts.

00:11:32.964 --> 00:11:34.674
I heard he even left
in the middle of a shoot

00:11:34.758 --> 00:11:35.842
because he got tired of waiting.

00:11:36.927 --> 00:11:38.136
Well, that day,

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.889
the director was on his laptop at the set

00:11:40.972 --> 00:11:44.893
and wouldn't stop
making revisions to the script.

00:11:45.977 --> 00:11:48.355
But of course, Mr. Lim was at fault too.

00:11:49.564 --> 00:11:51.316
It's frustrating for me too, sir.

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:53.401
The actor leaves in the middle of a shoot,

00:11:53.485 --> 00:11:55.195
and the director shuts down the set.

00:11:55.278 --> 00:11:57.405
They have to stop one-upping each other!

00:11:57.489 --> 00:11:58.865
They'll blow the schedule at this rate!

00:11:58.949 --> 00:12:00.075
Tell me about it, sir.

00:12:00.158 --> 00:12:03.912
I tried everything I could,
from sitting them down to coaxing them.

00:12:05.497 --> 00:12:07.165
Where has our Kang Pil-gu gone?

00:12:07.249 --> 00:12:10.877
The bright, eager eyes he once had
are nowhere to be seen.

00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:12.379
He's a totally different person now!

00:12:12.462 --> 00:12:14.422
How is our drama
supposed to turn out properly?

00:12:14.506 --> 00:12:15.382
Sir.

00:12:15.465 --> 00:12:18.468
I'll sit them down this time
and very strongly

00:12:19.386 --> 00:12:20.804
coax them.

00:12:20.887 --> 00:12:23.682
-Let's get that original spark back, okay?
-Right, original spark!

00:12:42.826 --> 00:12:44.661
I've gotten too jaded over the years.

00:12:44.744 --> 00:12:46.413
If the lead actor
wanted revisions to the script,

00:12:46.496 --> 00:12:48.248
I willingly made the revisions he wanted.

00:12:48.331 --> 00:12:51.543
I bent over backward to please
the production company and leading actor,

00:12:51.626 --> 00:12:54.212
all while tossing my own directing vision
straight into the trash.

00:12:54.296 --> 00:12:55.422
BEST DIRECTOR AWARD
BAK BYEONG-GI

00:12:55.505 --> 00:12:57.674
But I'm not going to do that anymore.

00:12:57.757 --> 00:13:00.051
I'm going to get my original spark back!

00:13:00.135 --> 00:13:02.846
The burning passion I had
while making my indie films.

00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:05.599
The pure creative drive I had
that nobody could interfere with.

00:13:05.682 --> 00:13:06.725
I'm bringing it all back

00:13:06.808 --> 00:13:08.226
and pouring it into this project.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.270
From this moment on, nothing and no one

00:13:10.353 --> 00:13:12.105
can stand in the way of it.

00:13:25.869 --> 00:13:26.745
I'm not…

00:13:27.954 --> 00:13:30.832
-the only one scared stiff, right?
-I think he lost his damn mind.

00:13:30.915 --> 00:13:32.417
Now what, Mr. Hwang?

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.919
It seems we just need Lim Hyeon-jun
to get his original spark back.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.345
You're getting a call.

00:13:44.137 --> 00:13:45.972
Right, sorry about that.

00:13:48.475 --> 00:13:50.685
Hello, it's Hwang Ji-sun speaking.

00:13:50.769 --> 00:13:52.687
This is Eunseong Group's
Corporate Planning Office.

00:13:52.771 --> 00:13:55.690
Mr. Hwang,
the board has decided to dismiss you.

00:13:55.774 --> 00:13:58.652
This dismissal is effective
immediately upon notification.

00:13:58.735 --> 00:14:00.695
Excuse me? Hold on a second.

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:02.280
Did you say dismissal?

00:14:02.364 --> 00:14:03.406
Are you telling me I'm fired?

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.908
Fired?

00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:05.909
Why would you get fired?

00:14:05.992 --> 00:14:07.911
I have no idea.

00:14:07.994 --> 00:14:10.080
I asked why they fired me,

00:14:10.163 --> 00:14:12.874
but all they said was that
the board had made their decision.

00:14:12.957 --> 00:14:13.875
Maybe you misheard him.

00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.627
Are you kidding me, bro?

00:14:17.837 --> 00:14:21.091
Wait, remember when
Ms. Wi came to our office?

00:14:21.174 --> 00:14:23.760
-Yeah.
-That day, she asked to see

00:14:23.843 --> 00:14:25.970
our company's financial statements
out of the blue.

00:14:26.554 --> 00:14:29.933
But if this continues,
King's Back will be at risk.

00:14:30.016 --> 00:14:31.351
And she said the company would be at risk.

00:14:31.434 --> 00:14:33.436
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.939
Ms. Wi is a very smart lady.
She wouldn't say that without good reason.

00:14:36.022 --> 00:14:38.108
Look, I know.

00:14:38.191 --> 00:14:40.485
So as soon as I got the call,
I ran to the office

00:14:40.568 --> 00:14:42.070
-to check our financial statements.
-Okay.

00:14:42.153 --> 00:14:43.363
But some guys told me

00:14:43.446 --> 00:14:45.573
that there'd been a sudden pipe burst,
and it was under construction.

00:14:45.657 --> 00:14:47.409
-They wouldn't let me in.
-Out of nowhere?

00:14:47.492 --> 00:14:48.702
-Weird, right?
-Yeah.

00:14:50.203 --> 00:14:52.163
Should we file a report with the police?

00:14:52.914 --> 00:14:55.583
No, do we report this
to the Ministry of Employment and Labor?

00:14:56.501 --> 00:14:57.419
Who? Me?

00:15:09.848 --> 00:15:12.225
Owning a building like this
in Gangnam is impressive.

00:15:12.934 --> 00:15:14.144
You're both truly impressive.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.021
You know former Assemblyman
Ha Gee-wan, right?

00:15:17.605 --> 00:15:18.982
During the Cheongwon City redevelopment,

00:15:19.065 --> 00:15:22.819
you let him use your name
and received money in return.

00:15:22.902 --> 00:15:24.738
That's absolutely ridiculous!

00:15:26.322 --> 00:15:27.532
What are you getting at?

00:15:27.615 --> 00:15:28.908
Don't you think

00:15:28.992 --> 00:15:31.745
buying a 40-billion-won building in cash
without taking a single loan

00:15:32.537 --> 00:15:34.038
is even more ridiculous?

00:15:34.122 --> 00:15:35.498
We don't know who Ha Gee-wan is,

00:15:35.582 --> 00:15:37.959
and we have nothing to say to you,
so please leave.

00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:39.419
Your brother didn't take his own life.

00:15:39.502 --> 00:15:41.880
You probably want to believe that he did,

00:15:41.963 --> 00:15:44.007
but both of you know it's not true.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.260
I'm not asking you
to come clean about everything today.

00:15:47.343 --> 00:15:48.178
But know

00:15:49.137 --> 00:15:52.140
that I'm going to clear
Mr. Woo Young-suk's name.

00:15:52.724 --> 00:15:54.058
I won't give up
no matter how long it takes.

00:15:55.059 --> 00:15:56.311
When you're ready to talk,

00:15:57.479 --> 00:15:58.438
give me a call.

00:16:00.523 --> 00:16:02.358
REPORTER WI JEONG-SIN
SPORTS EUNSEONG

00:16:07.489 --> 00:16:08.573
LIM HYEON-JUN

00:16:16.956 --> 00:16:18.082
This is Wi Jeong-sin speaking.

00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:19.918
Where are you?

00:16:21.878 --> 00:16:23.379
I'm out. Why do you ask?

00:16:23.463 --> 00:16:26.591
I'm sorry,
but could you come over right away?

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:28.718
To my place, I mean.

00:16:28.802 --> 00:16:29.677
To your place?

00:16:30.762 --> 00:16:31.721
What's this about?

00:16:31.805 --> 00:16:32.806
You'll know when you get here.

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:34.933
Come now, okay?

00:16:35.016 --> 00:16:35.850
But…

00:16:39.062 --> 00:16:39.896
What's going on?

00:16:47.362 --> 00:16:48.613
Why does he want me to come over?

00:16:52.909 --> 00:16:53.743
Ms. Wi!

00:16:54.619 --> 00:16:56.371
-You're here too, Mr. Hwang?
-Yes.

00:16:56.454 --> 00:16:58.873
The thing is, Mr. Hwang

00:16:58.957 --> 00:17:02.210
got fired from his own company.

00:17:03.211 --> 00:17:05.839
We thought you might have some insight,

00:17:05.922 --> 00:17:08.341
so I asked you to come
to discuss it together.

00:17:08.424 --> 00:17:10.093
You got fired?

00:17:10.176 --> 00:17:13.680
Yes! When you came to the office before,

00:17:13.763 --> 00:17:17.475
you asked to see our financial statements
and said something felt off.

00:17:17.559 --> 00:17:18.810
Why did you say that?

00:17:19.394 --> 00:17:22.856
Ms. Wi, I desperately need
your help right now.

00:17:22.939 --> 00:17:26.109
Well, can you think of
any reasons for your dismissal?

00:17:26.192 --> 00:17:27.235
Reasons?

00:17:27.777 --> 00:17:28.611
-Reason…
-What is it?

00:17:29.195 --> 00:17:31.030
Right, that thing…

00:17:31.114 --> 00:17:33.658
They suddenly said
they were conducting due diligence

00:17:34.367 --> 00:17:35.493
and asked me to sign an MOU…

00:17:35.577 --> 00:17:36.703
Or was it an MOW?

00:17:36.786 --> 00:17:40.039
-You need to get it straight!
-It was an MOU!

00:17:40.123 --> 00:17:43.918
They showed me an MOU
and asked me to sign it!

00:17:44.002 --> 00:17:45.920
-Did you sign it?
-Of course not.

00:17:46.004 --> 00:17:48.464
Something felt off,
so I asked them to explain it.

00:17:48.548 --> 00:17:50.049
And the next thing I knew,

00:17:50.133 --> 00:17:52.343
they held a board meeting
and got me fired!

00:17:52.427 --> 00:17:53.803
-How is that right?
-All right!

00:17:53.887 --> 00:17:56.222
I need you two to focus on me.

00:17:56.306 --> 00:17:57.599
I have something to explain.

00:17:57.682 --> 00:17:58.558
Okay.

00:17:59.684 --> 00:18:01.019
This all started

00:18:01.102 --> 00:18:04.564
with the long-term partnership
between Chairman Lee Dae-ho

00:18:04.647 --> 00:18:05.773
and FSS Director Ha Gee-wan.

00:18:05.857 --> 00:18:08.568
Lee Dae-ho provided
political funds to Ha Gee-wan,

00:18:08.651 --> 00:18:10.987
who then used his power
to help Lee Dae-ho in return.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.197
For example, information on
the Cheongwon City redevelopment.

00:18:13.281 --> 00:18:15.491
Thanks to Ha Gee-wan's information,

00:18:15.575 --> 00:18:18.745
Lee Dae-ho bought land for next to nothing
and made a huge profit.

00:18:20.038 --> 00:18:21.497
And in order to launder that money,

00:18:22.206 --> 00:18:24.626
he bought up entertainment agencies,
including King's Back.

00:18:24.709 --> 00:18:25.793
Damn it!

00:18:25.877 --> 00:18:28.504
-Hey, check out his huge catch!
-So that means

00:18:28.588 --> 00:18:31.049
Lee Dae-ho is the bad guy here, right?

00:18:31.132 --> 00:18:32.550
Are you saying that punk

00:18:32.634 --> 00:18:35.929
used our company to launder illegal funds?

00:18:38.222 --> 00:18:41.517
But right now, Chairman Lee
is having cash flow problems

00:18:41.601 --> 00:18:44.646
because the construction costs for
his apartment projects have skyrocketed.

00:18:44.729 --> 00:18:45.605
So that's why

00:18:45.688 --> 00:18:49.233
he's trying to put out the fire
by reselling the agencies at a high price.

00:18:49.317 --> 00:18:51.277
Mr. Hwang, the MOU you mentioned

00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:53.988
was part of the process
for selling King's Back.

00:18:54.697 --> 00:18:55.615
Damn it!

00:18:55.698 --> 00:18:59.577
Are you saying he sold off our company
because he was short on money?

00:18:59.661 --> 00:19:02.205
And he fired Mr. Hwang
because he was in the way?

00:19:02.288 --> 00:19:03.581
That's right.

00:19:04.248 --> 00:19:05.208
"In the way"?

00:19:05.291 --> 00:19:07.794
Then what are we supposed to do?

00:19:07.877 --> 00:19:09.921
Just sit back and take this?

00:19:10.004 --> 00:19:10.880
No.

00:19:10.964 --> 00:19:13.967
If we're going to strike back,
we need evidence first.

00:19:15.009 --> 00:19:16.094
-Mr. Hwang.
-Yes?

00:19:16.177 --> 00:19:18.304
You and I will go to your office tomorrow

00:19:18.388 --> 00:19:20.014
and gather the documents we need.

00:19:26.062 --> 00:19:26.938
Thank you.

00:19:27.021 --> 00:19:29.357
Ms. Wi, I feel like
I've got an army behind me,

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.067
-like nothing can stop me--
-Enough.

00:19:33.194 --> 00:19:34.070
Thank you so much.

00:19:35.363 --> 00:19:36.823
-Thank you.
-It's good you came.

00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:54.090
IMPERIAL PRINT

00:19:54.173 --> 00:19:58.094
Wow, I can't believe
this car has lasted this long.

00:20:00.304 --> 00:20:02.932
You let my uncle take over the print shop.

00:20:03.016 --> 00:20:06.019
-He's been driving it ever since.
-I see.

00:20:06.102 --> 00:20:09.105
I thought I'd bring it along as part of
the "Find Your Original Spark" project.

00:20:09.647 --> 00:20:11.190
Find my original spark?

00:20:11.899 --> 00:20:14.444
Jeez, not you too.

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:17.488
Gosh, it's like my first time in here.

00:20:17.572 --> 00:20:20.116
Was this car always so small?

00:20:20.199 --> 00:20:22.577
Try not to get into any fights
on the set today.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.121
It's not like I want to fight.

00:20:25.204 --> 00:20:27.832
Director Bak still isn't ready
with the script.

00:20:27.915 --> 00:20:30.168
I didn't want him to look bad
in front of the crew,

00:20:30.251 --> 00:20:32.712
so I stepped in to buy him some time.

00:20:35.798 --> 00:20:38.301
I wonder how Ms. Wi and Mr. Hwang's
agenda is going today.

00:20:38.384 --> 00:20:40.845
Man, I should've gone with them.

00:20:41.804 --> 00:20:43.056
Darn it.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.393
Look, it's my office.
Why won't you let me in?

00:20:47.477 --> 00:20:49.312
-You can't go in.
-Why not?

00:20:49.395 --> 00:20:51.898
Mr. Hwang's personal belongings
are in there too.

00:20:51.981 --> 00:20:54.734
He just wants to collect his things,
so what rights do you have to stop him?

00:20:54.817 --> 00:20:57.904
We're following the chairman's orders
not to let anyone in the CEO's office.

00:20:57.987 --> 00:20:59.947
If you have a problem,
talk to the chairman.

00:21:00.031 --> 00:21:01.532
The chairman told you to do this?

00:21:02.033 --> 00:21:05.620
Come on, don't be like this.

00:21:05.703 --> 00:21:08.539
Why bother the chairman
over something so small?

00:21:08.623 --> 00:21:10.333
How about this?

00:21:10.875 --> 00:21:13.252
Do you see my laptop over there?

00:21:13.336 --> 00:21:16.464
There's also a pair of luxury slippers
my wife got me for my birthday.

00:21:16.547 --> 00:21:18.925
I'll just pop inside
and grab those two things, okay?

00:21:19.008 --> 00:21:20.760
Damn it, we said no.

00:21:21.886 --> 00:21:22.845
Did you just hit me?

00:21:23.596 --> 00:21:24.806
Are you kidding me?

00:21:25.306 --> 00:21:27.058
Get out of my way, you punks!

00:21:28.768 --> 00:21:29.644
This is assault!

00:21:29.727 --> 00:21:32.063
What do you think you're doing? Move!

00:21:32.146 --> 00:21:33.481
-Move!
-Drag them out!

00:21:33.564 --> 00:21:36.317
-Let go of me!
-You damn bastards!

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.403
Damn it, I'm not leaving!

00:21:39.487 --> 00:21:40.363
Get off me!

00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:53.126
IMPERIAL PRINT

00:21:53.209 --> 00:21:54.085
Hello.

00:21:55.086 --> 00:21:56.045
Hello.

00:21:56.712 --> 00:21:57.547
Director Bak.

00:21:59.006 --> 00:22:00.007
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:22:00.091 --> 00:22:00.967
Good morning.

00:22:01.592 --> 00:22:03.177
-Go get ready.
-Okay.

00:22:08.349 --> 00:22:09.809
Don't you have anything to say to me?

00:22:11.185 --> 00:22:12.145
No, I don't.

00:22:15.773 --> 00:22:17.150
Well, is the script finished?

00:22:18.484 --> 00:22:19.569
I suppose…

00:22:20.153 --> 00:22:21.487
Jeez.

00:22:22.905 --> 00:22:23.739
What's that?

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.659
Why are you wearing your trophy
around your neck?

00:22:29.745 --> 00:22:31.789
It's like that Imperial Print car.

00:22:32.456 --> 00:22:33.666
-My original spark.
-What?

00:22:33.749 --> 00:22:36.210
It represents my commitment
to always remember

00:22:36.294 --> 00:22:39.088
the passion and purity of my past
and to find my original spark.

00:22:39.172 --> 00:22:41.215
I'm keeping it close so I won't forget.

00:22:42.341 --> 00:22:43.926
Director Bak.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.386
Come on, don't be like that.

00:22:47.346 --> 00:22:48.181
Oh, man.

00:22:48.264 --> 00:22:50.975
That crazy punk. He's insane.

00:22:51.058 --> 00:22:54.478
Why does he get so weird
whenever he directs something?

00:22:55.062 --> 00:22:56.063
Seriously.

00:22:56.564 --> 00:23:00.276
Pil-gu has done a complete 180
and is now a corrupt cop.

00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:02.236
He takes money from drug addicts
and goes to hostess bars.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.779
He's an absolute piece of shit.

00:23:03.863 --> 00:23:05.448
-Jeez.
-But your acting

00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:06.866
doesn't feel like a bad guy at all.

00:23:06.949 --> 00:23:09.035
You're trying your best
to make him seem nice!

00:23:09.118 --> 00:23:12.413
I really don't like any of this.

00:23:12.496 --> 00:23:15.583
Kang Pil-gu is a hero.
How could he become a corrupt cop?

00:23:15.666 --> 00:23:17.919
He's already in pain
from losing his friend.

00:23:18.002 --> 00:23:20.504
How does he go from that
to being obsessed with money?

00:23:20.588 --> 00:23:23.424
That's not who Kang Pil-gu is!

00:23:23.507 --> 00:23:25.092
Are you saying
you can't follow the script?

00:23:25.176 --> 00:23:27.303
It didn't seem right
when I read the project proposal,

00:23:27.386 --> 00:23:29.972
but the script just makes it
even more ridiculous!

00:23:30.056 --> 00:23:33.226
The whole thing feels forced,
Director Bak!

00:23:33.309 --> 00:23:34.769
When will you come to your senses?

00:23:36.229 --> 00:23:38.814
-What did you say?
-The writing is convincing enough,

00:23:38.898 --> 00:23:41.108
and it's not the kind
to deserve your criticism!

00:23:41.192 --> 00:23:43.444
-Do you seriously--
-What will it be?

00:23:43.527 --> 00:23:46.197
If you don't want to cooperate,
we'll call off the shoot now.

00:23:48.824 --> 00:23:49.909
Did you just threaten me?

00:23:50.993 --> 00:23:52.536
Do you have a death wish?

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.538
You're the one who left during a shoot.

00:23:56.874 --> 00:23:58.376
-But that was--
-In any case,

00:23:58.459 --> 00:23:59.961
from now on,

00:24:00.044 --> 00:24:01.754
we're going to follow the script to a T.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.881
Hey, Director Bak.

00:24:05.216 --> 00:24:06.676
Are you serious?

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:09.220
Hey, Bak Byeong-gi!

00:24:09.762 --> 00:24:10.721
HWANG JI-SUN

00:24:11.389 --> 00:24:12.431
Hey.

00:24:12.515 --> 00:24:14.642
Were you able to get all the documents?

00:24:14.725 --> 00:24:17.853
We couldn't even get into my office.
They kicked us out.

00:24:17.937 --> 00:24:19.981
What? Why?

00:24:20.064 --> 00:24:24.610
They stationed a bunch of hired thugs
in front of the building,

00:24:24.694 --> 00:24:26.279
and they wouldn't let us in.

00:24:26.362 --> 00:24:28.781
We tried to push our way in
and got into a scuffle.

00:24:28.864 --> 00:24:30.324
Ms. Wi's clothes got ripped.

00:24:30.408 --> 00:24:31.575
Her clothes got ripped?

00:24:31.659 --> 00:24:32.952
-Jeez, come on.
-Stop it.

00:24:33.953 --> 00:24:35.538
Why won't you let us in?

00:24:36.122 --> 00:24:36.956
You!

00:24:37.039 --> 00:24:39.792
Don't you dare move a step
until I get there!

00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:41.544
-Okay. Hello?
-Do you realize this is illegal?

00:24:41.627 --> 00:24:43.504
-Bro?
-We just want to pick up

00:24:43.587 --> 00:24:46.632
-some personal belongings.
-Man, he's really mad.

00:24:46.716 --> 00:24:48.926
Come on, it'll only take a moment.

00:24:50.094 --> 00:24:53.681
Just let us in for a minute! Damn it!

00:24:55.349 --> 00:24:57.101
Those damn thugs.

00:24:58.561 --> 00:24:59.520
Where are you going?

00:24:59.603 --> 00:25:01.439
Start the car right now!

00:25:02.148 --> 00:25:03.441
Mr. Lim, the shoot isn't over.

00:25:03.524 --> 00:25:05.651
Are you leaving again? You can't do that!

00:25:07.028 --> 00:25:08.237
Director!

00:25:08.321 --> 00:25:10.531
Director, we're in big trouble!
Hold this for me.

00:25:10.614 --> 00:25:11.741
We're in trouble.

00:25:11.824 --> 00:25:14.035
Mr. Lim yelled, "Start the car right now!"
and took off.

00:25:14.118 --> 00:25:14.952
Car? What car?

00:25:15.036 --> 00:25:16.579
-The Imperial Print car.
-Damn it.

00:25:17.955 --> 00:25:20.374
-There it goes!
-He's leaving again?

00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:22.626
Have you lost your damn mind?

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.589
-Assistant Director, you're driving!
-Yes?

00:25:26.672 --> 00:25:27.506
I'm driving!

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.176
-Let's go!
-I'll chase him down today!

00:25:30.926 --> 00:25:31.844
Get in!

00:25:33.346 --> 00:25:34.221
Go after him!

00:25:37.016 --> 00:25:38.601
Get moving!

00:25:43.898 --> 00:25:46.859
Come on, Gil-su. Step on it!

00:25:47.777 --> 00:25:49.737
Those bastards won't get away with this.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.199
Man, we should've told the director
we were leaving.

00:25:53.282 --> 00:25:54.241
Jeez.

00:25:54.325 --> 00:25:56.786
Why did you have to
bring this car along today?

00:25:56.869 --> 00:25:58.621
Come on, step on it!

00:25:58.704 --> 00:25:59.538
Damn it.

00:26:04.418 --> 00:26:06.712
I let him walk all over me,
so he treats me like a doormat?

00:26:08.464 --> 00:26:09.757
-Assistant Director.
-Yes, sir?

00:26:10.257 --> 00:26:12.385
How many scenes do we need to shoot today?

00:26:12.468 --> 00:26:13.344
Twelve scenes, sir.

00:26:13.427 --> 00:26:14.637
Right.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.015
We're shooting all 12 scenes today,
no matter what.

00:26:18.099 --> 00:26:21.519
Even if I we have to stay up all night
until we cough up blood,

00:26:21.602 --> 00:26:22.812
I'll get it all done.

00:26:24.855 --> 00:26:26.482
We can't lose that car, all right?

00:26:27.191 --> 00:26:28.025
Yes, sir.

00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:30.069
-Drive.
-Okay.

00:26:30.152 --> 00:26:31.237
Stay right behind him.

00:26:32.446 --> 00:26:32.478
We're not leaving until you let us in,
so move already!

00:26:32.478 --> 00:26:35.032
We're not leaving until you let us in,
so move already!

00:26:35.116 --> 00:26:36.200
That's right!

00:26:36.283 --> 00:26:38.786
Give me my luxury slippers back!

00:26:38.869 --> 00:26:39.954
Give them back!

00:26:40.037 --> 00:26:42.706
Give them… Yes, that's it! Give them back!

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:43.749
-Here.
-Hey!

00:26:44.625 --> 00:26:46.210
-What are you doing?
-Now, go.

00:26:46.836 --> 00:26:47.837
You jerk!

00:26:48.421 --> 00:26:50.673
-My slipper!
-I told you to move aside!

00:26:50.756 --> 00:26:51.882
Stop her.

00:26:51.966 --> 00:26:53.300
Damn it!

00:26:53.884 --> 00:26:55.678
-Damn it, get out of here!
-Move aside!

00:26:55.761 --> 00:26:56.762
I've never worn these.

00:26:56.846 --> 00:26:58.889
-Move!
-Let go of me!

00:26:58.973 --> 00:26:59.807
Damn it.

00:27:00.349 --> 00:27:01.183
Hey, let go.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.271
Ms. Wi! You little…

00:27:05.354 --> 00:27:07.106
Hey, move!

00:27:07.189 --> 00:27:08.607
IMPERIAL PRINT

00:27:19.827 --> 00:27:20.786
You bastards!

00:27:52.234 --> 00:27:53.068
No.

00:27:53.152 --> 00:27:54.987
Kang Pil-gu!

00:27:56.113 --> 00:27:58.491
Hey, take Ms. Wi and get out of here!

00:27:59.241 --> 00:28:01.577
Ms. Wi, over there!

00:28:03.496 --> 00:28:04.747
Damn it!

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.465
What's happening here?

00:28:17.801 --> 00:28:18.969
Mr. Lim?

00:28:21.472 --> 00:28:22.598
What the hell?

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.227
Are you kidding me?

00:28:27.937 --> 00:28:29.897
We've got a situation in the parking lot.
Everyone, get down here.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.483
Damn it, an actor's body is everything.

00:28:40.908 --> 00:28:41.784
Stunt team!

00:28:44.286 --> 00:28:45.246
Ready!

00:28:46.956 --> 00:28:48.499
Action!

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.594
That's right, lay him out!

00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:09.728
That's it!

00:29:09.812 --> 00:29:11.647
-Director, zoom in on them!
-Nice!

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.482
-Pan to the right!
-Yes, just like that!

00:29:26.412 --> 00:29:28.330
They say you can't fix people.

00:29:28.414 --> 00:29:29.248
But…

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.250
I do.

00:29:51.353 --> 00:29:52.354
Damn it.

00:29:55.232 --> 00:29:57.151
-What is it?
-What do you want?

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.779
-What are you doing?
-Damn it!

00:30:00.863 --> 00:30:02.615
Let go of me! What the hell?

00:30:02.698 --> 00:30:04.366
Time to take out the trash.

00:30:04.867 --> 00:30:06.410
-Let's go!
-That little…

00:30:35.939 --> 00:30:37.232
Come on. Let's go.

00:30:37.316 --> 00:30:38.150
Bro.

00:30:38.984 --> 00:30:40.069
Where are my slippers?

00:30:43.405 --> 00:30:49.745
ENTRY RESTRICTED

00:31:00.923 --> 00:31:03.342
It seems we won't be able to
conduct due diligence today.

00:31:14.561 --> 00:31:16.563
Are you okay?

00:31:16.647 --> 00:31:17.606
Are you hurt?

00:31:28.325 --> 00:31:29.159
Are you okay?

00:31:51.598 --> 00:31:52.808
Are you sure you're okay?

00:31:53.517 --> 00:31:54.351
Are you hurt?

00:31:54.435 --> 00:31:55.602
I'm totally fine!

00:31:56.895 --> 00:31:58.439
Are you sure you're okay?

00:31:58.522 --> 00:32:00.983
How could those damn thugs
treat such a delicate woman that way?

00:32:04.445 --> 00:32:06.363
Are you sure you're okay?

00:32:07.406 --> 00:32:08.782
Say something!

00:32:12.911 --> 00:32:15.080
-Mr. Hwang, are you okay?
-Yeah?

00:32:15.164 --> 00:32:16.373
We don't have time for this.

00:32:16.874 --> 00:32:19.710
Ms. Wi, we have to grab those documents.

00:32:19.793 --> 00:32:21.128
-Right.
-Jeez.

00:32:23.505 --> 00:32:24.840
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

00:32:27.134 --> 00:32:28.093
The documents are over there.

00:32:28.761 --> 00:32:29.595
Mr. Lim!

00:32:30.679 --> 00:32:31.764
Mr. Lim!

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.224
Byeong-gi.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:38.312
I thought you ran away from the set.
What just happened?

00:32:38.395 --> 00:32:41.648
I didn't run away.
I just left without telling you.

00:32:41.732 --> 00:32:42.733
-Byeong-gi.
-Yes?

00:32:42.816 --> 00:32:46.779
If it weren't for you and the stunt team,
I wouldn't have made it.

00:32:46.862 --> 00:32:49.239
Is there a problem with the company?

00:32:49.323 --> 00:32:51.742
Things are going very wrong
with the company.

00:32:51.825 --> 00:32:54.244
Those thugs just came out of nowhere and…

00:32:54.328 --> 00:32:55.162
Jeez.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:57.998
Look.

00:32:58.081 --> 00:33:00.042
I don't know what's going on,

00:33:00.125 --> 00:33:02.169
but it looks like
things have been sorted out.

00:33:02.252 --> 00:33:03.545
Let's head back to the set now.

00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:06.757
Justice lies in ruins,
yet you're worried about filming?

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.674
Change the schedule!

00:33:07.758 --> 00:33:10.010
Why do you think I followed you
all the way here?

00:33:12.095 --> 00:33:14.056
Unless there's a natural disaster,

00:33:14.139 --> 00:33:15.849
there will be no schedule changes.

00:33:15.933 --> 00:33:19.186
Mr. Lim, you're not going home today
until you shoot all 12 scenes.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.063
-Mr. Lim's manager?
-Yes?

00:33:21.146 --> 00:33:23.524
I'll be riding with Mr. Lim.
Please get the car ready.

00:33:24.107 --> 00:33:24.983
-Producer?
-Yes.

00:33:25.067 --> 00:33:25.984
-Assistant Director?
-Yes.

00:33:26.068 --> 00:33:29.112
Will you two please safely and quickly
escort Mr. Lim?

00:33:29.196 --> 00:33:32.157
Director Bak, I need to stay here…

00:33:32.241 --> 00:33:34.326
-Mr. Lim, let's go!
-You have 12 scenes.

00:33:34.409 --> 00:33:36.411
-Ms. Wi!
-We have to go now. Quickly!

00:33:36.495 --> 00:33:37.913
Hurry!

00:33:37.996 --> 00:33:39.456
Ms. Wi, should we take this too?

00:33:40.916 --> 00:33:43.001
-Yes, we'll take everything.
-Everything? Okay.

00:33:43.919 --> 00:33:47.089
Gosh, there's so much stuff. Here we go.

00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:49.007
What?

00:33:52.845 --> 00:33:54.304
Explain what happened.

00:33:54.388 --> 00:33:57.850
The security firm wasn't aware
that the due diligence team was visiting.

00:33:57.933 --> 00:33:59.476
Then Kang Pil-gu…

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.353
I mean, Lim Hyeon-jun suddenly appeared.

00:34:01.436 --> 00:34:04.147
All those thugs
couldn't take down a single actor?

00:34:04.231 --> 00:34:05.065
It wasn't like that, sir.

00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:07.276
Mr. Lim gathered a crew somehow,

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:12.030
and they all acted a little crazy,
like a horde of starving zombies.

00:34:12.906 --> 00:34:13.991
So?

00:34:15.993 --> 00:34:19.329
They made a scene over one guy
in front of the due diligence team?

00:34:20.622 --> 00:34:21.456
My apologies, sir.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:23.584
But the bigger problem was
that one of his crew

00:34:23.667 --> 00:34:25.502
recorded everything on his phone.

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:29.464
I worried the media would be all over it
if things got out of hand,

00:34:30.048 --> 00:34:31.550
so I ordered them to pull back for now.

00:34:32.551 --> 00:34:33.760
I'm very sorry, sir.

00:34:35.888 --> 00:34:37.764
-They're back.
-What's going on?

00:34:37.848 --> 00:34:40.100
-What happened?
-Were you guys in a fight?

00:34:40.183 --> 00:34:41.852
-Oh, gosh.
-What happened?

00:34:41.935 --> 00:34:44.730
-Are you okay?
-This looks really bad!

00:34:44.813 --> 00:34:47.149
We'll start shooting immediately,
so get ready!

00:34:47.232 --> 00:34:49.067
-Really?
-Right now?

00:34:49.151 --> 00:34:52.821
Let's reschedule the shoot.
We won't get it done tonight anyway.

00:34:52.905 --> 00:34:54.865
-I'll make it happen.
-What happened to you?

00:34:54.948 --> 00:34:56.158
-Producer!
-Are you okay?

00:34:56.658 --> 00:34:58.201
Cut. Okay!

00:34:58.827 --> 00:35:00.704
-Mr. Lim.
-Good job!

00:35:01.288 --> 00:35:02.497
-Nice work, everyone!
-Oh, man.

00:35:05.667 --> 00:35:06.501
Jeez.

00:35:08.712 --> 00:35:10.130
Mr. Lim, I'll bring the car around.

00:35:10.213 --> 00:35:11.089
Okay.

00:35:11.798 --> 00:35:13.884
-I'll remove my makeup, then.
-Okay.

00:35:14.509 --> 00:35:16.094
-Oh, man.
-Good job, sir!

00:35:16.178 --> 00:35:17.387
You too.

00:35:18.805 --> 00:35:19.848
Oh, gosh.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.228
Jeez. Here you go.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.359
Man, Byeong-gi is one determined punk.

00:35:30.442 --> 00:35:32.611
I can't believe we shot all 12 scenes.

00:35:34.571 --> 00:35:37.240
It looks like Director Bak
found his original spark.

00:35:37.324 --> 00:35:39.284
That damn original spark!

00:35:39.368 --> 00:35:40.285
Stupid spark.

00:35:42.496 --> 00:35:44.539
Anyway, what do we do now?

00:35:45.624 --> 00:35:47.793
I got fired,
but you're still tied to King's Back.

00:35:47.876 --> 00:35:49.419
Hey, what's to worry about?

00:35:50.003 --> 00:35:53.090
Just keep handling my work
the way you always have.

00:35:53.173 --> 00:35:55.384
I'll just hire you as a freelancer.

00:35:55.968 --> 00:35:58.679
Will you pay me
out of your own pocket, then?

00:36:00.472 --> 00:36:03.850
I'll make sure you get a bonus
on top of your salary.

00:36:03.934 --> 00:36:05.435
-How's that?
-Seriously?

00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:06.812
You're the best, bro!

00:36:13.318 --> 00:36:15.904
So does this mean
we can't ever go back to that office?

00:36:16.655 --> 00:36:20.701
We signed that office by running around
until our feet were covered in blisters.

00:36:20.784 --> 00:36:22.202
We painted the walls together,

00:36:22.285 --> 00:36:23.704
and we even got the chairs together.

00:36:23.787 --> 00:36:28.083
I've had a hand in everything there,
right down to the coffee mugs.

00:36:28.667 --> 00:36:31.920
I can't believe I'm not allowed inside.
This is so unfair!

00:36:33.046 --> 00:36:36.091
Hey, I'm still with King's Back.
Of course, you can go inside.

00:36:37.426 --> 00:36:38.343
Does that mean

00:36:39.052 --> 00:36:41.638
I'm no longer CEO Hwang?

00:36:41.722 --> 00:36:43.348
Am I Manager Hwang now?

00:36:44.016 --> 00:36:46.018
Am I supposed to call Gil-su
"team leader"?

00:36:46.101 --> 00:36:48.103
Oh, damn it.

00:36:48.186 --> 00:36:50.856
I haven't even told my wife yet.

00:36:50.939 --> 00:36:51.773
Hey!

00:36:53.066 --> 00:36:53.900
Stay confident!

00:36:54.693 --> 00:36:55.610
Jeez.

00:36:56.153 --> 00:36:58.071
Just use this place as your office.

00:36:58.155 --> 00:36:59.906
This is your seat. Got it, CEO Hwang?

00:37:01.533 --> 00:37:03.493
Anyway, those bastards…

00:37:04.077 --> 00:37:07.122
First, they fire you over the phone,

00:37:07.664 --> 00:37:09.666
then they send thugs to the company.

00:37:11.168 --> 00:37:13.587
How do we get back at those bastards?

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.339
Bro, didn't you stay up all night?
Are you going somewhere?

00:37:18.341 --> 00:37:19.176
Huh?

00:37:20.594 --> 00:37:22.054
I've got plans.

00:37:22.846 --> 00:37:25.891
What plans could you have
at a crucial time like this?

00:37:26.475 --> 00:37:29.102
Oh, you're going to see
Ms. Wi Jeong-sin again.

00:37:29.186 --> 00:37:30.270
I mean…

00:37:30.353 --> 00:37:33.982
Hey, I'm doing this for both of us.

00:37:34.066 --> 00:37:36.860
We need to figure out our next move.

00:37:36.943 --> 00:37:37.944
Right?

00:37:38.028 --> 00:37:40.447
-Do you plan on staying a manager forever?
-No.

00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:44.534
I'll meet with Ms. Wi to work out a plan,

00:37:44.618 --> 00:37:49.206
so you just sit tight and figure out
how to manage my work from now on, okay?

00:37:49.289 --> 00:37:50.415
And don't cry!

00:37:51.875 --> 00:37:52.959
See you later.

00:37:53.043 --> 00:37:54.336
Okay, bro. See you!

00:37:55.504 --> 00:37:58.131
Gosh, who knew
he was such a romantic at heart?

00:38:03.345 --> 00:38:05.138
Why did you come in a car like this?

00:38:05.722 --> 00:38:07.474
-What's wrong with it?
-It stands out!

00:38:07.557 --> 00:38:09.476
Come on, just get in.

00:38:09.559 --> 00:38:11.269
-No, you get in first.
-Huh?

00:38:11.353 --> 00:38:13.688
-Why? What is it? What's wrong?
-Get in.

00:38:13.772 --> 00:38:14.648
Jeez.

00:38:31.623 --> 00:38:35.001
Kang Pil-gu would never
drive a car like this.

00:38:35.085 --> 00:38:36.920
Oh, come on. It's fine.

00:38:37.003 --> 00:38:40.715
I'm not Kang Pil-gu.
I'm superstar Lim Hyeon-jun, so it's okay.

00:38:42.342 --> 00:38:43.718
How's Mr. Hwang holding up?

00:38:45.428 --> 00:38:48.515
He's in shock, of course,
and having a mental breakdown.

00:38:50.684 --> 00:38:52.394
Chairman Lee Dae-ho is a ruthless man.

00:38:52.477 --> 00:38:54.020
I'm sure he planned it all from the start.

00:38:54.104 --> 00:38:56.982
Gosh, why'd we have to get involved
with someone like him?

00:38:57.065 --> 00:39:00.485
I had a bad feeling
ever since I went fishing with him.

00:39:01.319 --> 00:39:04.656
But why are you digging into someone
that dangerous?

00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:05.824
Aren't you scared?

00:39:07.033 --> 00:39:08.034
No one else can do it

00:39:09.161 --> 00:39:10.120
except me.

00:39:11.121 --> 00:39:13.331
I've been holding onto this case
for a long time,

00:39:14.249 --> 00:39:15.667
and I want to get to the bottom of it.

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.670
Thanks to Mr. Hwang,
I've gathered nearly all the evidence.

00:39:19.796 --> 00:39:23.216
I'm just trying to figure out
the most effective way to expose it.

00:39:30.473 --> 00:39:31.474
Well…

00:39:31.975 --> 00:39:35.103
I'm not the type
to take crap from anyone, either.

00:39:37.272 --> 00:39:38.315
Let's think about it.

00:39:49.492 --> 00:39:52.245
Why are we the only ones here?

00:39:52.329 --> 00:39:53.371
Gosh.

00:39:53.955 --> 00:39:57.626
You only watch shows like Kang Pil-gu,
so you have no idea what's going on.

00:39:58.585 --> 00:39:59.419
Excuse me?

00:40:01.004 --> 00:40:04.299
If you watch melodramas or rom-coms,
you'd catch on right away.

00:40:05.467 --> 00:40:06.843
What do you mean?

00:40:07.469 --> 00:40:10.764
Haven't you ever seen dramas
where a wealthy heir or rich boyfriend

00:40:10.847 --> 00:40:12.349
rents out a whole place for a date?

00:40:12.933 --> 00:40:13.975
The whole place?

00:40:14.059 --> 00:40:15.393
You rented out the whole place?

00:40:16.686 --> 00:40:19.564
Don't you have better things
to spend your money on than this?

00:40:19.648 --> 00:40:21.775
Jeez, I knew you'd say that.

00:40:21.858 --> 00:40:22.984
I didn't spend any money.

00:40:23.568 --> 00:40:25.946
I just said I'd use it
since there's no shoot today.

00:40:27.197 --> 00:40:28.031
And I wanted

00:40:29.074 --> 00:40:30.283
to be alone with you.

00:40:32.244 --> 00:40:34.829
You're always so conscious of others
when you're with me.

00:40:39.459 --> 00:40:41.378
I come here every now and then.

00:40:41.461 --> 00:40:43.004
This is where I made my debut.

00:40:45.173 --> 00:40:46.841
It was just a minor role, but still.

00:40:48.009 --> 00:40:49.678
-The title was…
-The City of Romance?

00:40:53.139 --> 00:40:53.974
How did you know?

00:40:54.557 --> 00:40:56.351
It was one of the questions
when I joined your fan page.

00:40:57.102 --> 00:40:59.896
It was a real headache
trying to join that fan page.

00:41:47.152 --> 00:41:49.154
I think I've seen this place on TV.

00:41:51.364 --> 00:41:52.532
This takes me back.

00:41:54.326 --> 00:41:56.786
I think we filmed somewhere around here.

00:42:00.248 --> 00:42:02.876
By the way, how did you become an actor?

00:42:04.794 --> 00:42:07.339
I heard there was a part-time job
as an extra, so I came.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:10.467
For some reason,
I really liked being on set.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.510
And I thought I'd do well.

00:42:13.386 --> 00:42:15.764
So you were discovered
while working as an extra?

00:42:15.847 --> 00:42:16.973
Yes, pretty much.

00:42:18.099 --> 00:42:21.061
You have to admit,
my looks are hard to ignore.

00:42:21.144 --> 00:42:24.522
I'm good-looking now,
so imagine how handsome I was back then.

00:42:25.231 --> 00:42:28.443
As soon as the director saw me,
he gave me a line to say.

00:42:28.526 --> 00:42:30.904
But I'd never acted before,

00:42:30.987 --> 00:42:32.322
so how could I deliver that line?

00:42:32.405 --> 00:42:34.240
I was so nervous,

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.285
I still remember the line to this day.

00:42:41.414 --> 00:42:42.374
Wait!

00:42:47.003 --> 00:42:49.089
The last train just left.

00:42:53.134 --> 00:42:56.304
"The last train just left."

00:42:56.388 --> 00:42:57.639
Cut!

00:42:57.722 --> 00:42:59.307
I nailed it on the first take.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.311
It was exhilarating.

00:43:04.145 --> 00:43:06.523
After that,
I got right into studying acting.

00:43:06.606 --> 00:43:09.025
Then I gained experience in the theater.

00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:10.985
And then I eventually got into movies.

00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:12.404
What about Kang Pil-gu?

00:43:13.154 --> 00:43:14.406
How did you join Kang Pil-gu?

00:43:18.326 --> 00:43:20.787
It all started when a film student
came to my shop

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:22.997
to print the script
for his graduation project.

00:43:23.957 --> 00:43:25.291
Hello.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.295
I had a script printed here a while ago,

00:43:29.379 --> 00:43:32.841
and there's a bit of an issue.

00:43:33.425 --> 00:43:36.469
He begged me to be in his film, so I did.

00:43:37.178 --> 00:43:39.931
And it ended up receiving
a major award out of nowhere.

00:43:41.766 --> 00:43:45.061
Ever since, I've practically been
a slave to Kang Pil-gu.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.273
That college student
was Director Bak Byeong-gi.

00:43:49.315 --> 00:43:50.400
Really?

00:43:52.694 --> 00:43:56.531
So the director was your good luck charm.

00:43:58.366 --> 00:43:59.784
A good luck charm?

00:44:00.326 --> 00:44:02.495
You made a comeback as an actor
thanks to him.

00:44:02.579 --> 00:44:04.330
And you even got to meet Kang Pil-gu.

00:44:07.834 --> 00:44:11.880
Kang Pil-gu isn't just a drama character.

00:44:12.464 --> 00:44:13.548
He stands up for the weak,

00:44:13.631 --> 00:44:16.092
takes risks, and gives the bad guys
what they deserve.

00:44:17.343 --> 00:44:20.638
He helped me forget
my own troubles for a bit.

00:44:21.931 --> 00:44:24.684
A lot of people admire
Kang Pil-gu's sense of justice.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:29.272
You know police applications shot up
because of him, right?

00:44:30.023 --> 00:44:31.149
Kang Pil-gu is

00:44:31.232 --> 00:44:34.861
really, really special.

00:44:35.904 --> 00:44:38.698
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

00:44:39.574 --> 00:44:40.450
How lucky is that?

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.498
Yet you call yourself
a slave to Kang Pil-gu…

00:44:47.415 --> 00:44:50.877
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun,
you've lost your original spark.

00:44:53.796 --> 00:44:55.089
Come on.

00:44:55.173 --> 00:44:57.217
I'm being serious.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.970
I desperately want to play
a different character now.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:07.352
Although, I'll have to work hard
as Kang Pil-gu for now.

00:45:11.898 --> 00:45:15.068
Hyeon-jun said there's someone he likes.
Who is she?

00:45:15.151 --> 00:45:16.402
Did he tell you that?

00:45:16.986 --> 00:45:18.905
She doesn't exist, does she?
He must've lied to me.

00:45:18.988 --> 00:45:21.282
If you're so curious, ask him yourself.

00:45:21.366 --> 00:45:23.201
Don't put me on the spot like that.

00:45:23.284 --> 00:45:25.537
Then can you start
a dating rumor about him and me?

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.789
Jeez, that's a disaster waiting to happen!

00:45:28.915 --> 00:45:30.667
What's the matter with you these days?

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.961
I really want things
to work out with Hyeon-jun.

00:45:33.044 --> 00:45:37.048
Still, that's just too much.
I can't make up a rumor like that.

00:45:39.133 --> 00:45:40.510
Then can I start one?

00:45:40.593 --> 00:45:42.178
Come on, Se-na.

00:45:42.262 --> 00:45:45.682
Stop wasting your time,
and focus on this project.

00:45:46.391 --> 00:45:48.268
Anyway, why'd you ask to meet
at the production company

00:45:48.351 --> 00:45:49.978
instead of King's Back?

00:45:50.728 --> 00:45:52.188
I got fired.

00:45:52.272 --> 00:45:54.148
That's why
I'm using this place temporarily.

00:45:54.232 --> 00:45:55.650
What happened?

00:45:55.733 --> 00:45:57.569
Did you do something wrong?

00:45:57.652 --> 00:45:59.862
What could I have possibly done wrong?

00:45:59.946 --> 00:46:02.323
I think they wanted to
sell off the company,

00:46:02.407 --> 00:46:03.783
but I was in the way, so they fired me.

00:46:04.826 --> 00:46:06.369
Oh, right. Is your agency okay?

00:46:06.452 --> 00:46:10.540
Wouldn't they try to sell off
my company and yours at the same time?

00:46:12.667 --> 00:46:14.961
-Does Hyeon-jun know about this?
-Of course, he does.

00:46:17.922 --> 00:46:19.132
Just stay still for now.

00:46:19.757 --> 00:46:20.967
And keep a low profile.

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:22.468
I always stay still.

00:46:27.223 --> 00:46:29.809
I've been coming here for a long time.

00:46:29.892 --> 00:46:32.270
I don't bring just anyone here.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:36.774
So do we have nine more dates left?

00:46:36.858 --> 00:46:38.151
No, that's not right.

00:46:38.985 --> 00:46:41.321
We met today
because of Mr. Hwang's situation,

00:46:41.404 --> 00:46:42.530
so this doesn't count.

00:46:42.614 --> 00:46:44.115
That didn't even take five minutes.

00:46:46.284 --> 00:46:48.244
Five minutes is plenty.

00:46:48.953 --> 00:46:50.913
It's not something we can solve overnight.

00:46:53.541 --> 00:46:56.502
Let's eat quickly and get going.
The first episode airs tonight.

00:46:56.586 --> 00:46:58.338
What's the rush?

00:46:58.421 --> 00:46:59.922
I watched the rough cut.

00:47:00.465 --> 00:47:01.299
But I haven't watched it.

00:47:02.091 --> 00:47:04.052
I have to get home quickly
to watch it on time.

00:47:04.135 --> 00:47:05.053
Hurry up and eat.

00:47:10.683 --> 00:47:12.352
I'll treasure this moment

00:47:13.519 --> 00:47:15.271
for the rest of my life.

00:47:15.897 --> 00:47:19.025
No matter what role I take on
in the future,

00:47:19.942 --> 00:47:22.779
I promise to give my all
and remain a humble actor.

00:47:22.862 --> 00:47:23.863
Kang Pil-gu is

00:47:23.946 --> 00:47:27.075
really, really special.

00:47:27.158 --> 00:47:30.203
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

00:47:31.204 --> 00:47:32.455
How lucky is that?

00:47:35.875 --> 00:47:37.126
Thank you so much!

00:47:38.294 --> 00:47:40.088
-Hyeon-jun.
-Jeez, you scared me.

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.215
I'll be staying at my friend's tonight.

00:47:42.298 --> 00:47:43.633
-Which friend?
-Hong-sin.

00:47:44.217 --> 00:47:45.343
We're watching the first episode together.

00:47:45.927 --> 00:47:47.011
Hong-sin?

00:47:48.471 --> 00:47:51.182
Hey, where's the fun
if it's just the two of you?

00:47:51.265 --> 00:47:52.850
You need the main character.

00:47:52.934 --> 00:47:54.227
What? You're coming too?

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:55.603
Give me five minutes to get ready.

00:47:56.479 --> 00:47:57.897
Your motives seem pretty dishonest.

00:48:00.817 --> 00:48:02.944
There's nothing dishonest about them.

00:48:03.027 --> 00:48:05.113
You said you liked Ms. Wi too.

00:48:05.196 --> 00:48:07.949
You'd better help me out
unless you want me dating Su-ji.

00:48:11.494 --> 00:48:12.370
Jeez.

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.883
Here, I'll take that.

00:48:30.471 --> 00:48:32.056
Shall we go in?

00:48:33.975 --> 00:48:35.643
-Can we…
-Oh, yes.

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:48.656
You live in such a nice place.

00:48:49.449 --> 00:48:51.117
Why does your power go out so often?

00:48:52.702 --> 00:48:53.661
Why does it happen?

00:48:53.745 --> 00:48:55.163
And you could've gone to a hotel.

00:48:55.246 --> 00:48:57.540
Why insist on coming to our tiny place?

00:48:58.291 --> 00:49:01.043
Well, to kill two birds with one stone.

00:49:02.128 --> 00:49:03.671
I thought we could rehearse together.

00:49:04.839 --> 00:49:07.091
And since we've got
three characters from Kang Pil-gu here,

00:49:07.175 --> 00:49:09.719
I figured we could watch
the first episode together and chat.

00:49:09.802 --> 00:49:11.304
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:49:11.387 --> 00:49:12.680
Yes, it'd be totally nice.

00:49:14.515 --> 00:49:17.143
I'm sorry, but I really don't get it.

00:49:17.226 --> 00:49:18.895
-Of all places…
-Cut it out.

00:49:18.978 --> 00:49:20.229
What's wrong with you?

00:49:21.355 --> 00:49:23.357
Ms. Wi, I guess you're slow
to pick up on things.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:25.985
Hyeon-jun insisted on coming,

00:49:26.068 --> 00:49:28.321
-probably to see you.
-Hey.

00:49:29.197 --> 00:49:30.698
I guess you've been working out a lot.

00:49:30.782 --> 00:49:31.949
-But it's true.
-You're looking good.

00:49:34.869 --> 00:49:36.287
-Stop laughing.
-What?

00:49:40.666 --> 00:49:43.628
Mr. Lim, have you eaten yet?
I can make you ramyeon.

00:49:43.711 --> 00:49:44.837
Ramyeon sounds great!

00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:47.048
-I like it.
-Come and help me out.

00:49:47.131 --> 00:49:47.965
But there's so much food.

00:49:51.552 --> 00:49:53.179
Darn, we're out of ramyeon.

00:49:53.721 --> 00:49:54.972
We don't have any.

00:49:55.056 --> 00:49:56.808
-Don't open that.
-You don't have any?

00:49:56.891 --> 00:49:58.476
We'll go out and buy some ramyeon.

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.269
-Right now?
-Yes.

00:50:00.353 --> 00:50:02.522
-Hey!
-Get moving. Hurry up.

00:50:02.605 --> 00:50:04.065
-Hold on.
-Just go!

00:50:04.565 --> 00:50:07.026
-But we have so much food…
-Be quiet!

00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:08.069
All right, let's go.

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:18.830
Man, I'm so nervous.

00:50:21.415 --> 00:50:22.333
Mr. Lim!

00:50:30.675 --> 00:50:31.717
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5

00:50:47.108 --> 00:50:49.277
What's the point of asking
when you're about to die?

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.153
Mr. Lim, here comes your catchphrase.

00:50:52.488 --> 00:50:54.740
-They say you can't fix people.
-They say you can't fix people.

00:50:54.824 --> 00:50:55.825
But…

00:50:56.659 --> 00:50:58.828
-But I do.
-But I do.

00:51:03.749 --> 00:51:04.876
Kang Pil-gu is

00:51:04.959 --> 00:51:08.087
really, really special.

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:12.091
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

00:51:13.092 --> 00:51:14.343
How lucky is that?

00:51:17.138 --> 00:51:18.931
FIRST EPISODE VIEWERSHIP RATINGS: 4.3%

00:51:20.975 --> 00:51:23.603
What were the viewership ratings
for the first episode of season four?

00:51:26.856 --> 00:51:28.482
It was 12.4%.

00:51:28.566 --> 00:51:32.945
That's 8.1% higher
than this season's first episode.

00:51:33.029 --> 00:51:34.280
What about season three?

00:51:34.363 --> 00:51:35.615
It was 11.7%.

00:51:35.698 --> 00:51:37.867
Season 2 was 13.5%,

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:39.785
and season 1 was 8.9%.

00:51:40.411 --> 00:51:43.164
So that makes 4.3% an all-time low.

00:51:43.706 --> 00:51:45.791
Was there an important match
or something that night?

00:51:45.875 --> 00:51:46.751
Not at all.

00:51:46.834 --> 00:51:48.502
The weather was nice, though.

00:51:49.962 --> 00:51:51.964
Did everyone go out
to enjoy the weather, then?

00:51:53.424 --> 00:51:55.092
If this were any other drama,

00:51:55.176 --> 00:51:57.386
those ratings wouldn't be too bad
for a first episode.

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:01.015
The problem is, they're too low
compared to our previous seasons.

00:52:01.098 --> 00:52:03.434
That's right!
Remember what I said from the start?

00:52:03.517 --> 00:52:05.728
I said this season's storyline is weird.

00:52:06.312 --> 00:52:10.066
The viewers know exactly
what they want to see in Kang Pil-gu.

00:52:10.566 --> 00:52:12.985
Sure, for the sake of
changing the storyline,

00:52:13.569 --> 00:52:15.529
he can become a corrupt cop.

00:52:16.322 --> 00:52:19.700
But he needs to return
to the original Kang Pil-gu quickly.

00:52:19.784 --> 00:52:22.703
Do you really think that's why?

00:52:23.746 --> 00:52:25.748
Hey, they say an old eagle
is better than a crow.

00:52:26.332 --> 00:52:27.792
Kang Pil-gu still has what it takes.

00:52:27.875 --> 00:52:30.628
The ratings will shoot up, so don't worry.

00:52:35.341 --> 00:52:36.175
GOOD DETECTIVE KANG PIL-GU 5
BOUNCES BACK, MAKES LITTLE SPLASH

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:40.930
THE BIGGER CONCERN
IS THE VIEWERS' REACTION

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:47.603
Episode 1 was 4.3%.

00:52:47.687 --> 00:52:48.938
Episode 2 was 5.1%,

00:52:49.021 --> 00:52:50.481
episode 3 was 5.2%,

00:52:50.564 --> 00:52:52.441
and Episode 4 was 4.9%.

00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:57.613
That's enough, sir.

00:52:57.697 --> 00:53:00.116
We're taking hits everywhere.

00:53:00.199 --> 00:53:02.118
It's my fault for not being good enough.

00:53:02.201 --> 00:53:05.246
No single person is to blame
for these results.

00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:06.831
Even with a record-setting
production budget,

00:53:06.914 --> 00:53:08.457
the global star, Gwon Se-na,

00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:11.627
and a previous season
with ratings above 20%,

00:53:11.711 --> 00:53:13.295
if it's meant to fail, it'll fail.

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.967
Still, thanks to the overseas pre-sales,

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:19.427
I don't think we lost anything.

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:21.262
That's true.

00:53:21.345 --> 00:53:23.514
But it hurts to see Kang Pil-gu,

00:53:23.597 --> 00:53:26.600
a season drama that will go down
in our country's TV history,

00:53:26.684 --> 00:53:28.853
end in such a miserable and tragic way.

00:53:28.936 --> 00:53:30.604
It's just heartbreaking.

00:53:32.732 --> 00:53:34.734
I asked to promote it on UTube,

00:53:34.817 --> 00:53:37.028
but someone refused to listen.

00:53:37.778 --> 00:53:39.989
-Oh, Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun.
-Yes?

00:53:40.072 --> 00:53:41.657
-Congratulations.
-Excuse me?

00:53:41.741 --> 00:53:44.869
You hated playing Kang Pil-gu so much.

00:53:44.952 --> 00:53:47.204
Now you can't play him anymore,
even if you wanted to.

00:53:47.288 --> 00:53:48.330
You must be pleased.

00:53:48.914 --> 00:53:50.374
Well…

00:53:51.417 --> 00:53:54.545
The script is nearly complete,
and barely any scenes left to shoot.

00:53:54.628 --> 00:53:58.049
The only thing left for me to do
is focus on post-production.

00:53:58.758 --> 00:53:59.675
-Right.
-Yes.

00:53:59.759 --> 00:54:00.634
Of course.

00:54:01.594 --> 00:54:03.971
We may have missed out
on a grand farewell,

00:54:04.597 --> 00:54:07.808
but we must still give our best effort
until the very end.

00:54:10.186 --> 00:54:11.479
What effort?

00:54:18.652 --> 00:54:19.820
Oh!

00:54:21.489 --> 00:54:25.284
We should do something to spark
the viewers' interest in Kang Pil-gu.

00:54:25.868 --> 00:54:27.745
How about holding a press conference?

00:54:33.459 --> 00:54:35.461
A press conference?

00:54:35.544 --> 00:54:38.005
Is it too late for that?

00:54:40.633 --> 00:54:42.843
I'll now pass the mic
over to the reporters.

00:54:42.927 --> 00:54:45.012
We'll take some time
to discuss any questions

00:54:45.096 --> 00:54:47.807
they may have about
Good Detective Kang Pil-gu 5.

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:49.642
I have a question for Director Bak.

00:54:49.725 --> 00:54:52.103
The ratings have been low
up to the fourth episode.

00:54:52.186 --> 00:54:54.563
What should we look out for
in the upcoming episodes?

00:54:54.647 --> 00:54:57.483
You'll see why Kang Pil-gu had no choice

00:54:57.566 --> 00:54:58.734
but to become corrupt.

00:54:58.818 --> 00:55:01.695
I think the viewers will
understand Kang Pil-gu better

00:55:01.779 --> 00:55:04.156
and really immerse themselves
into the drama.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.367
We won't give up,

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.911
so please keep watching until the end.

00:55:08.994 --> 00:55:10.037
Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun,

00:55:10.121 --> 00:55:14.125
some reviews claim you haven't fully
understood your character this season.

00:55:14.208 --> 00:55:15.167
Do you agree?

00:55:16.418 --> 00:55:18.003
Yes, I admit it.

00:55:18.087 --> 00:55:22.591
This take on Kang Pil-gu
differs so much from his righteous image

00:55:22.675 --> 00:55:25.136
that I definitely felt pressure
playing him.

00:55:26.679 --> 00:55:29.098
I'm continuously communicating
with the director

00:55:29.682 --> 00:55:33.394
and working harder to portray
this new side of Kang Pil-gu

00:55:33.477 --> 00:55:35.229
in a way the viewers can accept.

00:55:37.106 --> 00:55:38.315
Go ahead.

00:55:38.399 --> 00:55:40.442
I find it meaningful
that Kang Pil-gu's character

00:55:40.526 --> 00:55:42.611
didn't follow
the previous success pattern,

00:55:42.695 --> 00:55:48.117
but instead chose to take on
a new challenge despite the risks.

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.243
-Did we give her the question?
-No.

00:55:49.326 --> 00:55:51.579
-There's anticipation for what is to come.
-She's a reporter.

00:55:52.163 --> 00:55:55.499
Could you say a few words
to die-hard fans like me?

00:55:57.751 --> 00:56:00.796
Well, first of all,
I'd like to thank all the viewers

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.007
who have shown
continuous love for Kang Pil-gu.

00:56:03.674 --> 00:56:07.303
To be honest, it wasn't an easy decision

00:56:08.179 --> 00:56:10.181
to join this season.

00:56:10.264 --> 00:56:13.434
I really wanted to break away
from the image of Kang Pil-gu

00:56:13.517 --> 00:56:15.144
that is so closely associated with me.

00:56:15.936 --> 00:56:19.481
I guess that desire
showed in my performance.

00:56:22.234 --> 00:56:24.445
But while filming this season,

00:56:24.528 --> 00:56:27.865
I came to realize once again
how special and precious

00:56:27.948 --> 00:56:30.576
the role of Kang Pil-gu is to me.

00:56:32.912 --> 00:56:34.205
Kang Pil-gu is

00:56:34.288 --> 00:56:37.583
really, really special.

00:56:37.666 --> 00:56:40.878
And you got to play
that extraordinary Kang Pil-gu.

00:56:41.754 --> 00:56:43.172
How lucky is that?

00:56:43.255 --> 00:56:47.968
So I returned to filming
with a renewed sense of affection.

00:56:49.303 --> 00:56:53.182
With twists and hints falling into place,
the story will get even more exciting.

00:56:53.766 --> 00:56:55.976
I truly appreciate your trust in me
and sincerely hope

00:56:57.061 --> 00:56:58.562
you'll stay with us until the end.

00:56:59.063 --> 00:57:00.564
This question is for Ms. Gwon Se-na.

00:57:00.648 --> 00:57:03.400
What was it like
acting with Mr. Lim Hyeon-jun?

00:57:03.484 --> 00:57:05.861
Even though it had been a while
since Sad Waltz,

00:57:05.945 --> 00:57:09.490
we worked together very well on set,
as if no time had passed.

00:57:10.074 --> 00:57:12.785
But when we were filming
close-contact scenes,

00:57:12.868 --> 00:57:14.954
he got incredibly shy.

00:57:17.498 --> 00:57:20.542
No, I didn't get shy.

00:57:20.626 --> 00:57:22.461
Who said I got shy?

00:57:23.128 --> 00:57:24.838
It wasn't that I felt shy.

00:57:25.798 --> 00:57:28.092
Kang Pil-gu only had crushies…

00:57:29.927 --> 00:57:31.428
I mean, he only had crushes.

00:57:31.512 --> 00:57:33.138
So since it was his first romantic scene,

00:57:33.222 --> 00:57:34.932
I guess he got slightly nervous.

00:57:36.433 --> 00:57:38.936
Who knew a seasoned actor
could get nervous?

00:57:39.019 --> 00:57:40.771
Next question, please.

00:57:43.983 --> 00:57:46.694
Mr. Lim, I heard you
recently got back together

00:57:46.777 --> 00:57:50.239
with an actress you dated in the past
after being apart for a long time.

00:57:50.906 --> 00:57:52.908
Could she be here with us today?

00:57:53.492 --> 00:57:54.910
Is it Gwon Se-na? They used to date.

00:57:54.994 --> 00:57:55.995
What's this about?

00:57:57.830 --> 00:57:58.914
-Is it true?
-I'm sorry,

00:57:58.998 --> 00:58:01.125
but please refrain
from asking personal questions.

00:58:01.208 --> 00:58:02.126
No, that's fine.

00:58:03.544 --> 00:58:04.670
I'll answer the question.

00:58:06.922 --> 00:58:09.425
You asked if the person I like
is here today.

00:58:14.638 --> 00:58:15.472
Yes, she is.

00:59:09.818 --> 00:59:12.029
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YEON-SEO
FOR HER APPEARANCE

00:59:14.531 --> 00:59:16.742
There isn't much time left.

00:59:16.825 --> 00:59:18.118
You have to release it soon.

00:59:18.827 --> 00:59:22.206
The documents you provided
will serve as the most crucial evidence.

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:24.541
Why won't they let me in?

00:59:24.625 --> 00:59:25.876
What are they up to?

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:29.505
But in reality,
things don't end as beautifully

00:59:29.588 --> 00:59:32.091
as they do in your dramas.

00:59:32.174 --> 00:59:33.634
I think Ms. Wi is in danger.

00:59:34.593 --> 00:59:36.845
What I said about the fine line
between cursed and fated.

00:59:38.305 --> 00:59:39.181
It turns out

00:59:40.015 --> 00:59:41.100
I was right.

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:48.232
