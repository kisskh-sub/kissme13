00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:03.880
Are you trying to turn my imperial study

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.519
into a football field?

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.840
I miss you, Your Majesty.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.760
I just wanted to see you.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.000
Is that wrong?

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:17.519
Where is Yunfei?

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.480
I sent someone to check on her,
but she wouldn't open the door.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:23.920
Get to the point.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:34.519
Emperors from the Chen family

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.560
are all the same, after all.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.079
You're all obsessed with your sisters

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.319
and crave substitutes.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.000
But honestly, Lady Yunfei
appeared out of nowhere.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:50.400
Your Majesty,

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:54.000
don't you find it suspicious?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.120
If you can't watch your tongue,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.439
I won't hesitate to make you a mute.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.639
Yunlin wasn't my sister by blood.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.280
Had she wanted to be the empress,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.879
no one could have stopped her,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.680
and I wouldn't have married you.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.159
I see Your Majesty

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.120
is quite taken with Lady Yunfei.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.520
What a pity that such a beauty

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:44.560
is already engaged.

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.039
It's none of your business.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.919
Seeing her face,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.000
Your Majesty,

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.800
your mind must be

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:56.879
racing with thoughts.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.719
I know Your Majesty

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.199
hasn't let go of the Grand Princess.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.879
So you've been planning

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.719
to keep Lady Yunfei

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.960
by your side.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.000
Your Majesty.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.879
Reluctant as I am,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.280
I will help fulfill your desire

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.080
and mend your regrets.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.080
I've been alone in Zhuozhou for so long.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.240
I wrote you 26 letters in total.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.479
Yet Your Highness only

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.360
sent one reply.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.639
The dignified Grand Tutor,

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.120
only after a few days,

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.399
has started writing nonsensical letters.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.279
Now you can't even

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.240
watch your tongue.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.079
Heaven bears witness.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.879
Every word I say is true.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.360
Day and night,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.439
I yearn for Your Highness alone.

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:40.120
Zhuozhou is freezing.

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:44.519
I hold onto your letters for warmth
to sleep every night.

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.439
You should've burned them.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.439
You've overstepped.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:00.600
There are people...

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:08.759
I learned a trick in Zhuozhou.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.160
Just interlock our fingers.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.079
And our voices
won't carry beyond these walls.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.680
Why not just sew your mouth shut?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.040
I couldn't.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.160
If I sewed my mouth shut,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.680
how could I express my feelings
for Your Highness?

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.639
You have plenty of other ways.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.240
With your mouth shut,

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:45.800
you could still do it
with your hands and eyes.

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.160
So you're saying

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.519
that my feelings

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.959
are perfectly clear to Your Highness.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:02.680
Don't forget.

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:05.399
You're merely my pawn.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.160
Do not overstep.

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:12.639
(Your Highness.)

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.000
(Since you're using me,)

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.800
(why not use me more thoroughly?)

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.120
Your Majesty has been busy.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:54.000
Why don't you rest early?

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:56.959
I'll pay my respects to you tomorrow.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.160
Your Majesty.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.839
I'm afraid I've overstayed my welcome.

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:12.759
I'd rather go home soon.

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:13.800
Why is that?

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.160
Because of the empress?

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.319
I promise

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.600
she won't dare approach you again.

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:21.560
Your Majesty.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.279
Somebody.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:24.240
Pass on my decree.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.959
If the empress trespasses
on the imperial study again,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.160
I'll remove her from her position.

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:30.000
Understood.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:31.879
Your Majesty.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.120
I shall take my leave.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.759
(Her clothes already)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.360
(carry the agarwood scent.)

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:46.199
(If she stays more...)

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.040
You're back.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.199
My lady.

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:05.600
The weather is dry.

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:08.040
You've even got chapped lips.

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:10.240
Have some water.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.480
Stop nagging.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.480
Why are you dressing your wound here?

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:17.720
What do you think?

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:19.480
I've been waiting

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.839
for you all day.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.480
I've treated the wound on my arm.

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:29.120
But my lady,

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:31.920
here.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.960
What should I do

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.120
about the wound on my shoulder blade

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.720
without your help?

00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:44.759
No need to change the dressing

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:46.440
as often in this dry weather.

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:52.279
I treat you wholeheartedly.

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:54.240
But you play mind games with me.

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:58.320
If you were to cast me aside,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.799
I might as well die.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.159
No, no.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.960
Fine, I'll do it.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.399
Stop howling.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.279
You smell so nice.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.080
Do me a favor, my lady.

00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:22.624
Don't use Xie Fei's medicine.

00:09:22.624 --> 00:09:25.000
It hurts too much. I can't bear it.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.480
So it hurts, huh?

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:30.080
Still running that mouth?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.000
Save your energy for healing.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.080
Your Highness.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.279
You're still here?

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:41.679
I was concerned

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:44.279
that some scoundrel might disturb you.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.360
So I came to check on you.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.200
Grand Tutor Xie

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.519
shared a bed with me just days ago.

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.960
Everyone in the Chen State knows.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:56.320
And now,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.399
he's changing my dressing in person.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.399
Is he really obsessed with me?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.799
Are you really obsessed with me?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.639
Done.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.559
My lady.

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:26.159
You just sat there and watched him

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.320
bully me?

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.840
You are the Seventeenth Prince of Qi.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.759
If you weren't practically
begging to be bullied,

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.159
who would dare bully you?

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:43.240
What is this?

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.240
I've never seen it.

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:48.200
Xuzhou pastries.

00:10:57.559 --> 00:11:01.080
I tasted them once
when I practiced martial arts as a kid.

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:03.120
Your master bought them for you?

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:06.919
See if it tastes the same.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.200
I haven't had one

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.759
for so many years.

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:19.600
I'm from the Qi State.

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:21.679
My lady,

00:11:22.919 --> 00:11:24.039
I've never tasted them.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.799
Makes sense.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.240
Qi pastries must differ from ours.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.159
Try it.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.159
Don't you have hands?

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:35.200
My lady, it's so sweet.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.720
Tea from Jigu Mountain in Jiangcheng?

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.759
Yes.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.320
It's the only pouch of new tea.

00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:54.919
I kept it with me,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.559
hoping to give it to you myself

00:11:58.279 --> 00:11:59.159
when I see you.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.559
You remember that I love
new teas from different places.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.039
He's so thoughtful.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.320
Although he only brought a pouch of tea,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.639
it's enough

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.320
for me to share with you.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.559
(Xie Fei.)

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.679
(You despicable man.)

00:12:24.759 --> 00:12:27.879
But the jade hairpin
is taking a long time to polish.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.399
I wanted

00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:32.399
to carve it meticulously.

00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:34.720
You'll outshine

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.440
the spring with it.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.000
Spring's beauty

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.440
pales before our love.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.120
Spring fades. But you must not.

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:45.159
(Oh, no.)

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:47.480
(My lady has fallen for a scoundrel.)

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.960
It's getting late.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.679
I'll leave now.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.440
Tomorrow, I'll guide Zhuozhou officials

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.000
to discover the gunpowder.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.120
Chancellor Huo will surely panic

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.120
and check on the gunpowder
in the capital.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.240
We'll catch him in the act.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.600
Be careful.

00:13:08.919 --> 00:13:09.840
Stay safe.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.519
The matter is grave.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.720
I'll take Feng Wuhen with me.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.399
He's staying by your side,

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.639
clearly up to no good.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.120
It's a precaution.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.759
(Who gave you the right)

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.559
(to speak ill of me?)

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:38.240
They found those spots?

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.360
Seven out of thirteen.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:44.639
Caught you.

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:49.080
Move them.

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:57.519
The hounds

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.559
chase the blood scent relentlessly,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.960
unaware they're charging
blindly towards a cliff.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.200
Time to end the game.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.279
It's fishy.

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:30.759
Take a look.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.500
Understood.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.320
Alert the Zhuozhou authorities.
