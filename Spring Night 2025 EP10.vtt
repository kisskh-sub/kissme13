00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.160
I'm telling you.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.200
When the emperor saw

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.840
his only son

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.440
dead beyond recognition,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.680
he wept bitterly and passed out.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.760
He hasn't attended court for days.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.240
The entire court

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.800
is now under my control.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.560
How did a mere county magistrate

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.280
dare to make a fool of me!

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.200
Do you know how much gold

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.480
I've given the Prime Minister?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.520
Madam.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.280
Bring a pot of wine.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.760
Prime Minister?

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.400
Prime Minister!

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.800
Your student greets you.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.720
Rise.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.560
It's you! Why did you kick me today?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.720
This man was harassing women
at the academy

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.680
and running his mouth,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.840
claiming to be your disciple.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.440
Prime Minister, don't you remember me?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.560
I'm Liu Chen, the jieyuan scholar.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.760
For this title,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.560
I gave you a whole chest of gold

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.880
and a high-grade jade ruyi scepter!

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.720
Have you forgotten?

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.200
Oh, it's you.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.040
Seems I shouldn't accept money

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.560
from just anyone anymore.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.000
Especially from fools like you.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.560
Prime Minister!

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.280
Clean this up.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.920
(The Crown Prince's death is confirmed.)

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.160
(Penglai Village
is no longer under scrutiny.)

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.120
(If Crown Prince truly lost)

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.160
(all his memories,)

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.280
(living quietly as Ye Wuming)

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.840
(with Nian)

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.160
(might be a good thing.)

00:04:34.784 --> 00:04:37.216
(Odd Jobs Shop)

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.640
Guo Daqiao, right?

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.200
Sister!

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.680
Right.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.480
Hurry up! I'm exhausted.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.200
Come help Wuming grind the ink.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.400
Grind the ink.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.920
There are so many people.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.840
You're number one.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.960
Number two.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.680
Number three.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.160
Number four.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.880
Number five.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.440
Please wait.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.880
Let me introduce you.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.120
Your headband's loose.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.560
Well,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.360
weddings...

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.080
Whatever you need. We handle it all.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.760
Done.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.080
No need.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.480
Done.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.520
Why are you tying everything

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.760
like that?

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.200
Tying it this way makes it tighter.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.160
I see.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.840
You only know this one knot, right?

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.360
No such thing!

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.560
Drafting a legal petition.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.160
(How could this be?)

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.600
Okay, take a look.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.368
(This isn't the knot
my brother always ties.)

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.120
Are you sure it wasn't him?

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.280
Maybe he just forgot.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.160
The mind may forget,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.960
but the body remembers.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.240
Therefore,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.960
Ye Wuming is definitely not my brother.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.960
If he's not,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.760
how do you explain the jade pendant?

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.320
There may be another explanation.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.240
But Ye Wuming cannot be my brother.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.600
If he's not,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.560
why does he have the pendant?

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.000
Anyway, he's not my brother.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.520
Don't be mad.
I didn't say it must be him.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.840
There are still many things

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.320
we haven't sorted out.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.400
No matter what,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.200
I need to talk to him
and clear things up.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.560
Mai Tian.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.440
Don't argue with him.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.040
How am I supposed

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.640
to explain to him?

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.760
I treated him badly.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.600
He must hate me by now.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.960
Got it.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.360
Perhaps

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.560
I can make him some clothes.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.560
But I don't have

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.120
much time for clothes.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.080
And the fabric's from others.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.160
Besides,

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.480
I didn't even take his measurements.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.360
Maybe make some food?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.680
No way.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.720
I'm not a good cook.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.160
What should I do?

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.120
Forget it.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.560
I'll just say it straight.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.120
Anyway, he wouldn't kick me out.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400
Today's earnings.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.360
Ye Wuming?

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.280
This is today's take.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.240
Ye Wuming.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.760
Let me see how much.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.520
So much!

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.320
Ye Wuming.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.720
Ye Wuming, I need to talk to you.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.440
Mai Tian.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.120
We only married
because of the imperial decree.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.320
If you regret it...

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.000
If you regret it,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.680
I'll let you go.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.720
I didn't mean that.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.000
Then what do you mean?

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.000
I can feel dad and you

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.160
treat me differently.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.840
I'm just curious

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.480
why you suddenly changed.

Who is he?

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.960
You've known him for long, right?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.240
Were you together

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.200
when I was on labor?

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.800
No! That's not it!

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160
I really don't know him! Trust me.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.720
There's nothing between us.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.960
I trust you.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.680
But do you trust me?

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.760
Do you believe how I feel about you?

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.560
You don't.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.920
I... I do believe you!

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.680
You can't prove it.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.680
You can't prove it.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.560
Is this proof enough?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.240
That's ridiculous!

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.360
Why was the jade pendant with you?

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.440
So

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.880
you really don't know
where it came from?

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.080
I don't remember at all.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.080
But it's okay.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.400
At least

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.200
our misunderstanding is cleared up.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.440
As for the jade pendant...

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:46.920
One day,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.200
I will remember.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.360
I was worried

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.640
you hated me because I kept my distance

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.400
lately.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.760
How could I?

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.840
I thought I had done something wrong.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.520
I overthought it all day.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.440
Wait.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.120
What is it?

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.280
So the childhood engagement

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.400
and my corvée labor

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.400
were all lies?

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.840
I'm sorry.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.480
You know the situation.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.600
I had no choice.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.760
Alright.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.280
I know.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.560
It's fine.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.680
I've lost my memory anyway.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.400
All I know now is

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.040
that I'm your husband,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.520
and you're my wife.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.520
I knew you'd say that.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.400
Father!

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.920
It's late.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.440
What are you doing out here?

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.000
I'm not here to interrupt.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.280
I'm looking for this.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.880
Ye Wuming.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.800
There's something you need to know.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.880
Actually,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.120
Mai Tian isn't my biological daughter.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.160
Father!

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.160
He's your husband now.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.120
He has to face this truth.

00:12:36.037 --> 00:12:37.520
(To stand for the people.
To uphold conscience)

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.000
The owner of these paperweights

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.560
is Mai Tian's real father.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.400
Fifteen years ago,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.000
Shen Jinyuan

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.680
was framed.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.800
The entire Shen Mansion was executed.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.240
At that time,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.560
only his son and daughter escaped.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.080
I was an old servant of the Shen family.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.960
I risked my life

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.480
to save them.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.360
But

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.160
the Shen family's eldest son
has since vanished.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.360
And Mai Tian is Shen Jinyuan's daughter.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.160
Father.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.120
Four Sentences of Hengqu.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.080
I never expected Lord Shen

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.280
shared the same ideals

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.600
as Master Mingcheng.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.360
Remarkable.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.960
Ye Wuming.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.440
You're good at learning.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.160
Are you willing

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.720
to take the imperial exam,

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.560
enter official service,

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.560
and someday

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.240
clear Lord Shen's name?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.160
I am willing.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.520
Great.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.160
Then, what is your real name?

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.360
Shen Zhinian.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.440
Shen Zhinian?
