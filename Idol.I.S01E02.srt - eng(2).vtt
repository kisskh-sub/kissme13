Universe's best, Do Ra-ik!

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:53.116
Smiling angel, Kang Woo-seong!

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.535
Shining, Lee Young-bin

00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:58.454
Heart-breaker, Choi Jae-hee!

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:01.958
I love you, Gold Boys!

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:06.796
He looks really pretty today.

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.093
Universe's best, Do Ra-ik!

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:17.015
He's so handsome.

00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:23.855
I love you, Do Ra-ik!

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.577
Mr. Do Ra-ik.

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:47.378
Mr. Do Ra-ik.

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:49.339
No.

00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:51.216
That can't be.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.551
Why…

00:01:55.637 --> 00:01:57.096
Why would Woo-seong die?

00:01:57.722 --> 00:01:58.890
Why Woo-seong?

00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:01.309
No way.

00:02:04.604 --> 00:02:08.191
I know it's hard to believe,
but this really happened.

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:12.695
Early this morning, Mr. Kang Woo-seong…

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.283
was murdered at your house.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.916
I'm Maeng Se-na from Cheon-un Law Firm.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.669
I'm not sure if you're aware,

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:31.047
but our firm handles the legal counsel

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.298
-for your agency.
-Stop.

00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:34.300
Stop it.

00:02:34.384 --> 00:02:35.760
Right now, the police

00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:38.888
consider you the prime suspect.

00:02:38.972 --> 00:02:41.224
They have made
an emergency arrest of a public figure.

00:02:41.307 --> 00:02:44.060
-There must be significant evidence--
-I said stop!

00:02:44.143 --> 00:02:46.187
Enough with that crazy nonsense!

00:02:46.688 --> 00:02:48.022
Why would Woo-seong be dead?

00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:51.067
Just last night
we were drinking together, singing,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.152
planning the concept for our next album!

00:02:56.197 --> 00:02:57.657
It's a lie.

00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:00.118
It's a lie!

00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:02.745
It's a lie, right? It's a lie, isn't it?

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:11.754
This makes no sense.

00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:14.090
Why Woo-seong…

00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:18.094
To find that out, I need your statement.

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:21.097
I need to know exactly what happened,

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.558
whether anyone else came by,

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:27.645
or if there's anyone who might have held
a grudge against you or Woo-seong.

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.772
Who do you think you owe your success to?

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:33.401
Ra-ik, I know it's you.

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:35.528
My love, Do Ra-ik, you're so mean.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.655
Your phone number!

00:03:39.115 --> 00:03:39.949
Hey!

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.201
Ra-ik!

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:44.370
-How can you treat your fans like this?
-Fans?

00:03:44.454 --> 00:03:47.540
You're cockroaches.

00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:50.168
Filthy, disgusting, revolting, you know?

00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:51.669
What? Cockroaches?

00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:53.046
Hey, Do Ra-ik!

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.131
Who do you think made you this successful?

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:57.425
That's right. We made you.

00:03:57.508 --> 00:04:00.345
Your name, your popularity,
everything you're enjoying right now.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.680
We made all of it.

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:04.891
You could never get rid of us.

00:04:04.974 --> 00:04:08.144
Not until we're done with you.

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:10.271
You can't run!

00:04:11.356 --> 00:04:12.732
There is someone with a grudge!

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:14.817
Those crazy obsessive fangirls!

00:04:18.905 --> 00:04:20.073
Obsessive fangirls?

00:04:22.283 --> 00:04:23.618
You mean…

00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:26.746
Your fans?

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:29.040
Fans or whatever,
those crazy fangirls did it!

00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:32.126
They follow me everywhere,
screaming their heads off,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.213
calling and texting me every day,
driving me insane all day.

00:04:35.296 --> 00:04:38.007
They even broke into my house recently.

00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:40.134
It was them! It was those psychos!

00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:44.972
I knew it, those insane bit****.

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:48.559
They act all sweet to my face, f**k,

00:04:48.643 --> 00:04:51.896
but behind my back,
driving me f**king insane.

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.816
When they broke into my house,
I should've had them thrown in jail.

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.984
Not doing it, that's my biggest regret.

00:05:02.448 --> 00:05:03.408
Detective.

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:06.869
What do you mean he's in a meeting?

00:05:06.953 --> 00:05:08.871
-With whom?
-Come on.

00:05:09.455 --> 00:05:13.668
You're already tripping over each other?

00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:16.754
There she is.

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:25.847
Hey!

00:05:30.351 --> 00:05:31.769
How did you know to come here?

00:05:31.853 --> 00:05:34.313
Did that jerk, Assistant Jang, report it?

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:37.066
Hey!

00:05:38.442 --> 00:05:41.195
You know, jumping
a potential client like that

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.614
is against the legal ethics code, right?

00:05:43.698 --> 00:05:44.532
Hey!

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:46.492
I'm the one in charge
of Goldie Entertainment.

00:05:46.576 --> 00:05:49.745
So obviously, this case is mine too.
Completely mine. Okay?

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:56.586
All right, take care.

00:05:57.962 --> 00:05:59.005
Hey!

00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:02.300
What's with you?

00:06:03.384 --> 00:06:04.886
Why'd you give up so easily?

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:10.850
Did he confess?
Is he saying he really killed him?

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.744
Don't come in without permission.

00:06:30.244 --> 00:06:32.163
-She's coming out!
-She's coming out!

00:06:32.246 --> 00:06:34.665
-Is Do Ra-ik the main suspect?
-Did he admit to the charges?

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:36.125
I just need

00:06:36.834 --> 00:06:38.211
to watch from afar.

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:41.255
That's enough.

00:06:43.674 --> 00:06:47.345
-Is he being charged with murder?
-Is he connected to this case?

00:06:47.428 --> 00:06:49.013
There is someone with a grudge!

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:50.723
Those crazy obsessive fangirls!

00:06:55.186 --> 00:06:57.104
MURDERER

00:06:57.188 --> 00:06:58.147
So annoying.

00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.774
MAENG SE-NA

00:07:00.816 --> 00:07:03.027
When life suddenly collapses
in an instant,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.947
in a moment you never even saw coming.

00:07:06.739 --> 00:07:07.823
Disgusting.

00:07:07.907 --> 00:07:09.700
I heard her dad killed someone.

00:07:09.784 --> 00:07:10.993
That's right.

00:07:11.953 --> 00:07:13.579
She reeks.

00:07:13.663 --> 00:07:15.498
Maybe she's got the same genes.

00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:17.500
She might kill someone, too.

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:19.377
Yeah, right.

00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:20.878
A murderer.

00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:23.047
When the pain came crashing in
like a tidal wave,

00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:26.300
unnoticed by anyone.

00:07:28.302 --> 00:07:29.929
And when even I

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.810
could no longer protect myself.

00:08:00.668 --> 00:08:01.836
In that moment,

00:08:04.213 --> 00:08:05.506
the only one in this world

00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:08.968
who comforted me

00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:11.012
was you.

00:08:11.095 --> 00:08:16.475
On the day your whole world
Starts to fall apart

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.816
I can feel your footsteps
As you wander

00:08:25.568 --> 00:08:31.115
Searching for a place to lean on

00:08:34.785 --> 00:08:40.708
I'll hold you in my arms

00:08:42.209 --> 00:08:47.381
You who are worn out from so much pain

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:56.390
In the deepening night

00:08:56.474 --> 00:09:03.064
A shining star will light your sky

00:09:04.023 --> 00:09:07.526
And I'll be here

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:13.949
So the rough waves never
Shake you again

00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:14.950
DROPOUT APPLICATION

00:09:15.034 --> 00:09:18.120
Please, turn your eyes to me

00:09:20.873 --> 00:09:24.418
All the days you've blossomed

00:09:25.002 --> 00:09:27.046
They're all…

00:09:27.129 --> 00:09:29.131
There's a song I recorded in here.

00:09:30.007 --> 00:09:32.718
I made it when I was at my lowest.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.598
I hope it can bring you
even a bit of comfort.

00:09:37.682 --> 00:09:43.104
In the deepening night

00:09:43.187 --> 00:09:44.772
A shining star…

00:09:44.855 --> 00:09:46.899
When I first met you,

00:09:47.733 --> 00:09:49.360
I made up my mind.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.613
I decided to live.

00:09:54.824 --> 00:09:56.701
2010 GED EXAM SAMPLE QUESTIONS

00:09:57.785 --> 00:10:00.496
Let's just try living.

00:10:02.498 --> 00:10:05.876
Maybe someday,
I'll find a reason to stay alive.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.965
I want you to recognize yourself
You've dreamed of

00:10:11.048 --> 00:10:16.637
So petals can bloom
And color you completely

00:10:16.721 --> 00:10:19.765
CASE STUDIES AND PRECEDENTS
IN CRIMINAL LAW

00:10:19.849 --> 00:10:23.561
Under the starlight

00:10:23.644 --> 00:10:27.314
Just the two of us

00:10:27.398 --> 00:10:33.904
I won't ever let go of this hand

00:10:34.655 --> 00:10:41.078
Not until those stars lose their shine

00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:44.999
Even when time passes

00:10:45.082 --> 00:10:48.878
Think of me again

00:10:51.464 --> 00:10:56.802
If the rain ever falls
On your heart once more

00:10:58.763 --> 00:11:05.102
I promise I'll be right by your side

00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:08.856
GOLDIE ENTERTAINMENT UNVEILS GOLD BOYS

00:11:10.483 --> 00:11:14.653
Up next is a four-member band
making their very first debut performance!

00:11:14.737 --> 00:11:16.906
Please welcome our shining rookie group,

00:11:16.989 --> 00:11:20.159
Gold Boys, with a big round of applause!

00:11:20.242 --> 00:11:21.076
What?

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.077
CHUNHYANG FESTIVAL

00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:24.872
Isn't Kim Seong-jin
supposed to be on today?

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.721
-Someone's there.
-No way.

00:11:40.804 --> 00:11:43.933
That's not Kim Seong-jin, who is that?

00:11:44.016 --> 00:11:46.227
I want to see Kim Seong-jin.

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:48.270
Gold Boys, let's go!

00:11:53.275 --> 00:11:54.610
Let's go!

00:11:55.486 --> 00:11:56.737
-Let's go!
-Yeah.

00:11:57.947 --> 00:11:58.864
Yeah, okay.

00:12:00.407 --> 00:12:02.868
Hello, we're Gold Boys!

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.174
I don't need anything anymore

00:12:17.258 --> 00:12:19.677
No one can interfere with me

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.347
I've been alone from the
Very start anyway

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.723
Never touch me

00:12:24.807 --> 00:12:27.309
From now on, you don't exist to me

00:12:27.393 --> 00:12:29.436
I'll show you that this world

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.897
Is a stage made only for me

00:12:31.981 --> 00:12:34.525
I just wanna be the rockstar

00:12:34.608 --> 00:12:37.486
Cut the useless talk

00:12:39.488 --> 00:12:41.907
This is where it really begins

00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:43.784
Let's go rock 'n roll

00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:48.038
I'm the rockstar…

00:12:50.165 --> 00:12:51.292
Because you're the one

00:12:52.126 --> 00:12:54.169
who made me see that.

00:12:57.548 --> 00:13:01.594
I was… able to stay alive.

00:13:03.637 --> 00:13:04.555
But…

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.144
It's just because he went through
something awful,

00:13:11.353 --> 00:13:13.022
he'd never…

00:13:14.523 --> 00:13:16.150
He'd never do something like that.

00:13:17.985 --> 00:13:19.069
Right?

00:13:20.237 --> 00:13:21.155
I don't know.

00:13:24.533 --> 00:13:25.868
You tell me.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.786
Which one am I?

00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:32.666
You created me.

00:13:34.043 --> 00:13:37.963
So you should decide the answer.

00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:42.426
Which one do you want?

00:13:43.927 --> 00:13:45.179
A wrongfully accused victim?

00:13:47.348 --> 00:13:48.265
Or…

00:13:50.142 --> 00:13:51.560
a murderer with two faces?

00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:55.481
I…

00:13:58.192 --> 00:13:59.652
What I want is…

00:14:01.612 --> 00:14:02.613
the real you.

00:14:05.032 --> 00:14:06.367
The real Ra-ik.

00:14:08.827 --> 00:14:10.162
The real Ra-ik?

00:14:16.752 --> 00:14:17.711
No…

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.924
That's not Ra-ik, he's…

00:14:24.385 --> 00:14:25.594
My Ra-ik is…

00:14:25.678 --> 00:14:26.929
It's not?

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.306
Then who is it?

00:14:30.849 --> 00:14:32.059
Who is

00:14:33.477 --> 00:14:35.062
the real me?

00:15:04.967 --> 00:15:06.093
Eat.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.430
You need a bit of carbs in you

00:15:09.513 --> 00:15:12.266
for your brain to work properly.

00:15:12.349 --> 00:15:14.059
It helps bring back memories,

00:15:14.143 --> 00:15:17.604
and lets you figure out
what's actually good for you.

00:15:17.688 --> 00:15:18.605
Here.

00:15:20.858 --> 00:15:23.068
Let's keep the current stance, all right?

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.779
Answer only with "yes" or "no,"
keep it short.

00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:28.032
It's been hard, hasn't it?

00:15:28.615 --> 00:15:32.161
Mr. Kang Woo-seong
really didn't deserve to die.

00:15:32.244 --> 00:15:34.788
No one has a bad word to say about him.

00:15:34.872 --> 00:15:38.792
Kind, diligent,
and on top of that, incredibly talented.

00:15:38.876 --> 00:15:42.212
I heard he was a leader
the whole team depended on.

00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:45.466
But

00:15:46.383 --> 00:15:49.303
why would you fight
with someone like that?

00:15:49.386 --> 00:15:52.431
-No, the reason we fought was--
-So there was a fight.

00:15:53.057 --> 00:15:55.309
-You acknowledge there was a dispute.
-All right.

00:15:57.019 --> 00:15:59.313
Don't get dragged in, understand?

00:16:00.314 --> 00:16:04.860
He's famous for digging into people
until he gets the statement he wants.

00:16:04.943 --> 00:16:06.111
Hey!

00:16:06.195 --> 00:16:08.322
Was it me who got under your skin?

00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:10.824
No, Kang Woo-seong did.

00:16:11.575 --> 00:16:16.538
Look, murder is actually pretty simple.

00:16:16.622 --> 00:16:19.208
Friends drink together and start arguing.

00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:22.377
"You're wrong," "No, you're wrong,"
and then,

00:16:23.462 --> 00:16:25.005
someone gets stabbed.

00:16:25.506 --> 00:16:28.258
Guys like Kang Woo-seong
are always a bit annoying, right?

00:16:28.342 --> 00:16:30.302
Looking down on people
because he's the leader,

00:16:30.385 --> 00:16:32.262
acting like he knows better…

00:16:32.888 --> 00:16:35.265
Don't you dare talk when you know nothing.

00:16:37.184 --> 00:16:38.727
Don't frown.

00:16:39.228 --> 00:16:42.648
You'll get wrinkles on that pretty face.

00:16:43.398 --> 00:16:46.235
I won't ask for the cleaning fee.

00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:49.196
In exchange, I'll add another charge.

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:51.031
-Obstruction of official duties.
-Yes, sir.

00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:54.451
If you keep losing your temper…

00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:56.203
What kind of person are you?

00:16:56.286 --> 00:16:59.206
You're supposed to be my lawyer.
So why aren't you defending me?

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:02.251
Please, calm down first.

00:17:07.673 --> 00:17:09.716
Mr. Do Ra-ik.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.512
The prosecution is
about to request an arrest warrant.

00:17:14.138 --> 00:17:17.057
So if you're going to confess,
you'd better hurry.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.518
You'll need that sentence reduction.

00:17:30.195 --> 00:17:32.948
You quit defending Mr. Do Ra-ik?
How could you do that?

00:17:35.534 --> 00:17:38.871
Why? You thinking of taking him in?

00:17:40.247 --> 00:17:42.958
Forget it. He's rotten fruit.

00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:46.086
With the arrest warrant about to be filed,
how can you just quit now?

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.506
You said it was your big chance,
so you wouldn't even let me near it.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.260
Mr. Do Ra-ik is about to go to trial
without a lawyer, do you get that?

00:17:54.386 --> 00:17:56.889
Hey, and what about you?

00:17:57.514 --> 00:18:00.225
-Didn't you step away knowing it all?
-Knowing what?

00:18:01.226 --> 00:18:05.063
The prosecutor in this case.
It's that hard-headed Kwak Byung-gyun!

00:18:05.647 --> 00:18:07.357
Didn't you back off knowing everything?

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.153
-Who?
-Hard-headed Kwak Byung-gyun.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.032
The golden boy of the High Prosecutor
Kwak Jong-chul's family.

00:18:15.115 --> 00:18:16.491
You've never heard of him?

00:18:21.538 --> 00:18:26.084
An elite three-generation legal family
dating back to the first president.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:27.961
You know,

00:18:28.045 --> 00:18:31.089
that family's been desperate to get
into politics for years, don't you?

00:18:31.173 --> 00:18:34.009
He's using this case to boost his name,
so he can waltz into politics.

00:18:34.092 --> 00:18:38.096
If I try too hard to win,
the High Prosecutor will blacklist me.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.058
If I go easy and lose,
the press will chew me up.

00:18:42.392 --> 00:18:46.271
So really, who in their right mind
would take on a mess like this?

00:19:16.551 --> 00:19:20.097
DO RA-IK, HE WAS TRASH FROM THE START
MURDER IDOL

00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:50.043
Find the real killer
who murdered Kang Woo-seong!

00:19:50.127 --> 00:19:52.504
-Find the killer!
-Find the killer!

00:19:52.587 --> 00:19:55.340
Reveal the truth
of Kang Woo-seong's unjust death.

00:19:55.424 --> 00:19:57.384
-Reveal the truth!
-Reveal the truth!

00:19:57.467 --> 00:20:00.304
Find the real killer
who murdered Kang Woo-seong!

00:20:00.387 --> 00:20:02.055
-Find the killer!
-Find the killer!

00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:05.225
Reveal the truth
of Kang Woo-seong's unjust death.

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:07.102
-Reveal the truth!
-Reveal the truth!

00:20:07.185 --> 00:20:10.230
Find the real killer
who murdered Kang Woo-seong!

00:20:10.314 --> 00:20:12.149
-Find the killer!
-Find the killer!

00:20:12.232 --> 00:20:15.319
Reveal the truth
of Kang Woo-seong's unjust death.

00:20:15.402 --> 00:20:17.195
-Reveal the truth!
-Reveal the truth!

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:18.572
Find the real killer!

00:20:18.655 --> 00:20:19.906
I LOVE YOU, KANG WOO-SEONG

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.491
MAY YOU BE HAPPY IN A BETTER PLACE.

00:20:21.575 --> 00:20:23.201
YOU'LL ALWAYS SHINE IN MY HEART.

00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:25.329
Reveal the truth
of Kang Woo-seong's unjust death.

00:20:25.412 --> 00:20:27.456
-Reveal the truth!
-Reveal the truth!

00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:31.793
Woo-seong…

00:20:38.508 --> 00:20:39.593
How could he…

00:20:40.552 --> 00:20:42.596
How could he do that to a person?

00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:44.681
The investigation isn't over yet.

00:20:45.307 --> 00:20:48.602
-Ra-ik could be a victim too.
-A victim? What victim?

00:20:50.604 --> 00:20:54.316
All the police are saying
that lunatic is the killer.

00:20:56.943 --> 00:20:58.945
And think about it.

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:02.324
Someone was dying right outside,
there's no way he wouldn't have known.

00:21:02.407 --> 00:21:03.742
Does that make any sense to you?

00:21:03.825 --> 00:21:06.703
GOLDIE ENTERTAINMENT'S STOCK PLUNGES
AFTERMATH OF THE IDOL MURDER CASE?

00:21:06.787 --> 00:21:07.829
All right.

00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:11.041
I understand what you're saying.

00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:15.420
But until we finish sorting out
our official position internally,

00:21:16.088 --> 00:21:18.757
make sure you all keep your mouths shut.

00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:20.926
And…

00:21:21.009 --> 00:21:22.552
REPORTER BAEK

00:21:26.056 --> 00:21:28.058
Take the boys back to the dorm.

00:21:28.141 --> 00:21:30.310
-Sir…
-I said take them.

00:21:31.353 --> 00:21:32.354
Yes.

00:21:38.193 --> 00:21:39.528
Hey, let's go.

00:21:40.612 --> 00:21:42.447
What do you mean
by sorting out our position?

00:21:42.531 --> 00:21:43.782
Let's go outside for now.

00:21:48.703 --> 00:21:49.996
Sir!

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.415
Reporter Baek.

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:56.837
We agreed a long time ago, didn't we?

00:21:57.629 --> 00:22:01.133
No matter what happens,
we would never contact each other again.

00:22:01.216 --> 00:22:03.844
Yes, I was going to stick to that too,

00:22:03.927 --> 00:22:06.555
but something important came up.

00:22:06.638 --> 00:22:09.099
You should've received
a photo just now, right?

00:22:15.522 --> 00:22:18.817
You know Ra-ik had a fan meeting
before the incident, right?

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.069
That person was there that day too.

00:22:21.862 --> 00:22:24.114
Isn't it all a bit too coincidental?

00:22:25.407 --> 00:22:27.159
I wondered, if just like back then,

00:22:27.242 --> 00:22:30.579
this person might be connected somehow.

00:22:38.795 --> 00:22:40.463
You were right.

00:22:44.176 --> 00:22:45.719
It looks like

00:22:46.845 --> 00:22:48.388
Woo-seong really is dead.

00:22:52.893 --> 00:22:55.187
I thought about it over and over.

00:22:56.229 --> 00:22:57.606
-And that day--
-No.

00:22:58.148 --> 00:22:59.524
Please don't say anything.

00:23:00.567 --> 00:23:03.862
I'm not your attorney yet.

00:23:06.156 --> 00:23:08.450
I'll ask you one simple question.

00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:16.791
From this point on,
look straight into my eyes

00:23:18.084 --> 00:23:19.753
and answer only with "yes" or "no."

00:23:22.714 --> 00:23:24.174
Did you kill

00:23:25.133 --> 00:23:26.593
Mr. Kang Woo-seong?

00:23:28.929 --> 00:23:32.974
-If I say no, will you believe me?
-I won't ask a third time.

00:23:34.184 --> 00:23:35.393
Did you kill him?

00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:37.145
No.

00:23:37.229 --> 00:23:39.147
No, I didn't!

00:23:40.357 --> 00:23:42.317
How many times do I have to answer?

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.819
I swear I didn't!

00:23:47.405 --> 00:23:49.115
I even questioned myself.

00:23:49.991 --> 00:23:51.910
What if I really did that to Woo-seong?

00:23:52.619 --> 00:23:54.871
But no, no way.

00:23:55.455 --> 00:23:56.831
I don't believe him.

00:23:56.915 --> 00:24:00.252
Clients always lie for their own gain

00:24:00.752 --> 00:24:04.547
exaggerating whatever helps them
and burying anything that doesn't.

00:24:06.299 --> 00:24:07.842
But there's one thing I'm certain of.

00:24:07.926 --> 00:24:09.052
Hey!

00:24:09.135 --> 00:24:10.220
NEVER MET A WOMAN LIKE HER

00:24:15.267 --> 00:24:17.811
You're the first woman
who's ever called me "hey."

00:24:18.937 --> 00:24:22.941
I sat through that drama where you did
all that bad acting, so I know.

00:24:23.024 --> 00:24:23.858
-Cute.
-Do Ra-ik.

00:24:27.028 --> 00:24:29.906
You could never act this well.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.533
I like you.

00:24:34.744 --> 00:24:38.873
The law protects us all

00:24:38.957 --> 00:24:44.587
A better world is
One where the law is alive

00:24:44.671 --> 00:24:48.508
And within the law,
We can all be free…

00:24:48.591 --> 00:24:50.427
It's the prison wake-up song.

00:24:52.512 --> 00:24:54.139
And if things go wrong,

00:24:54.806 --> 00:24:57.851
that's what you'll be hearing
every morning at 6 a.m.

00:24:59.811 --> 00:25:03.648
Of course, things would be different
if I took on your case.

00:25:07.777 --> 00:25:10.488
But before we sign a retainer agreement,
I have one condition.

00:25:12.657 --> 00:25:14.868
If you agree to that one condition,

00:25:15.493 --> 00:25:16.703
I'll prove your innocence,

00:25:17.746 --> 00:25:19.331
without fail.

00:25:26.379 --> 00:25:28.048
That woman is completely crazy.

00:25:28.673 --> 00:25:30.925
Where did you even find someone like that?

00:25:31.009 --> 00:25:32.135
Is she really a lawyer?

00:25:36.973 --> 00:25:40.435
Anyway, get me another lawyer.

00:25:40.518 --> 00:25:41.978
Someone expensive and competent.

00:25:43.271 --> 00:25:44.939
She's the only one.

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:47.901
No one else is willing to take your case.

00:25:50.362 --> 00:25:51.321
And…

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.784
I can't help you anymore either.

00:25:56.826 --> 00:25:59.079
The CEO ordered the legal team

00:25:59.162 --> 00:26:01.623
to look into your contract
to terminate it.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.254
-What?
-Why did you do that?

00:26:10.757 --> 00:26:12.842
Why…

00:26:24.604 --> 00:26:26.147
You can say no.

00:26:26.773 --> 00:26:30.485
But in the end,
you won't be able to refuse.

00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:33.446
With all the attention
this case is getting,

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.365
the public pressure will only grow.

00:26:35.448 --> 00:26:36.908
IS THIS THE END FOR GOLD BOYS?

00:26:36.991 --> 00:26:38.827
Especially the prosecutor on this case,

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.288
he has a vicious temperament
and can't stand losing.

00:26:42.372 --> 00:26:46.543
And with the powerful backing he has,
no lawyer will step up easily.

00:26:46.626 --> 00:26:49.212
Punish Do Ra-ik!

00:26:49.295 --> 00:26:53.174
Severely punish Do Ra-ik
for killing Kang Woo-seong!

00:26:53.258 --> 00:26:55.009
-Punish him!
-Punish him!

00:26:55.093 --> 00:26:59.389
As time goes on, your chances
will only keep getting smaller.

00:26:59.472 --> 00:27:01.558
A public defender
would say something like this.

00:27:01.641 --> 00:27:03.518
The evidence is just too clear.

00:27:05.728 --> 00:27:07.772
If we insist on claiming innocence,

00:27:07.856 --> 00:27:10.442
and it turns out otherwise,
things will get much worse for you.

00:27:11.568 --> 00:27:14.279
It's better to acknowledge it
as an impulsive act committed

00:27:14.362 --> 00:27:17.866
-under diminished capacity, and--
-Claim self-defense and intoxication.

00:27:19.284 --> 00:27:21.453
You think I killed him too, don't you?

00:27:21.536 --> 00:27:23.955
If you accept charges
and ask for leniency,

00:27:24.581 --> 00:27:26.875
the sentence will likely end up
around 15 years.

00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:31.045
How can I confess
to something I never did?

00:27:35.592 --> 00:27:36.634
Just go.

00:27:37.218 --> 00:27:38.678
I already have an attorney.

00:27:39.596 --> 00:27:43.683
Prosecutors have requested
an arrest warrant for Do Ra-ik,

00:27:43.766 --> 00:27:46.853
a member of the popular idol group
Gold Boys, on charges of murder.

00:27:46.936 --> 00:27:50.565
The pre-arraignment hearing,
also known as the warrant review,

00:27:50.648 --> 00:27:53.276
is scheduled to take place tomorrow
at around 2 p.m.

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:55.570
Through this hearing,
the court will determine

00:27:55.653 --> 00:27:57.822
whether Mr. Do's arrest is necessary…

00:27:57.906 --> 00:27:59.866
-Yes, Ye-sol.
-Attorney.

00:27:59.949 --> 00:28:02.702
I just got a call
from Gangseo Police Station.

00:28:02.785 --> 00:28:04.787
It's about Mr. Do Ra-ik…

00:28:09.125 --> 00:28:11.377
Please prepare and submit
his attorney appointment form.

00:28:12.295 --> 00:28:13.421
Yes.

00:28:14.464 --> 00:28:16.174
I'll be going in later this afternoon.

00:28:16.257 --> 00:28:19.052
Before then, I need you
to request an attorney visitation.

00:28:21.054 --> 00:28:23.556
And arrange a meeting with the CEO.

00:28:24.224 --> 00:28:26.184
Yes, I'll see you later.

00:28:27.894 --> 00:28:28.895
Get up.

00:28:30.939 --> 00:28:32.023
Get up!

00:28:36.236 --> 00:28:37.904
-What is it?
-Let's go.

00:28:37.987 --> 00:28:39.030
Go where?

00:28:39.113 --> 00:28:40.031
To work.

00:28:49.582 --> 00:28:52.919
You said you completely quit the fandom!
You even cleared out all your merch.

00:28:53.002 --> 00:28:56.464
I didn't take this case as a fan.
I took it as a lawyer.

00:28:56.548 --> 00:28:59.342
Because even one person
being wrongfully accused is unacceptable.

00:28:59.425 --> 00:29:00.927
Innocent?

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.763
-It's obvious he's the culprit!
-Is that so?

00:29:04.639 --> 00:29:06.975
Then it should be easy to find evidence
that he's the culprit.

00:29:07.934 --> 00:29:09.185
A little before the incident,

00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:11.980
some girls apparently broke into his house
without permission.

00:29:12.063 --> 00:29:13.731
They seemed like obsessive fans,

00:29:13.815 --> 00:29:16.150
but he didn't report it
because he didn't want the drama.

00:29:16.234 --> 00:29:18.736
The security guards there
might know something.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.780
Go talk to them, and track down

00:29:20.864 --> 00:29:23.116
the identities of those obsessive fans,
no matter how.

00:29:23.199 --> 00:29:24.325
Before the warrant review.

00:29:25.451 --> 00:29:26.744
What? Wait…

00:29:28.288 --> 00:29:29.497
Seriously…

00:29:41.551 --> 00:29:44.053
A luxury villa
surrounded by vast green space.

00:29:49.392 --> 00:29:53.688
And among them,
the scene of the incident is

00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:55.481
over there, Building 103, fourth floor.

00:29:56.733 --> 00:29:57.817
Ra-ik's home.

00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:03.907
And on the second floor of Building 102,
is the dorm shared by Gold Boys members

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:09.787
Kang Woo-seong, Choi Jae-hee,
Lee Young-bin.

00:30:12.373 --> 00:30:14.334
According to Do Ra-ik's statement,

00:30:14.417 --> 00:30:16.961
on the day of the incident,
at around 8:10 p.m.,

00:30:17.795 --> 00:30:21.925
the victim, Kang Woo-seong,
visited the suspect's residence.

00:30:30.141 --> 00:30:32.435
About ten minutes later,

00:30:32.518 --> 00:30:34.896
the housekeeper, Seo Hyeon-suk, went home…

00:30:58.878 --> 00:31:03.967
leaving only Kang Woo-seong
and Do Ra-ik inside.

00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:11.808
This is where the murder took place.

00:31:13.434 --> 00:31:17.355
The estimated time of death
is between midnight and one a.m.

00:31:21.275 --> 00:31:25.488
A sudden downpour began around that time,

00:31:26.614 --> 00:31:28.241
and someone brought

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.411
Kang Woo-seong to his death.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:40.253
Was it Ra-ik?

00:31:43.172 --> 00:31:45.675
And if it wasn't him,
if it were a third party,

00:31:46.467 --> 00:31:51.639
how did that person manage to get in here?

00:31:52.306 --> 00:31:54.017
Thank you for your service.

00:31:56.102 --> 00:32:00.314
Kwak Byung-gyun, Criminal Division three,
Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office.

00:32:00.398 --> 00:32:01.441
Good to meet you.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.696
The police line
should've been lifted by now.

00:32:08.072 --> 00:32:10.908
It feels like a case I need to watch
to the very end.

00:32:10.992 --> 00:32:12.035
All right, then.

00:32:12.577 --> 00:32:16.247
Seeing it in person makes it harder
to find an answer, Attorney Maeng Se-na?

00:32:22.336 --> 00:32:23.796
You're very considerate.

00:32:24.672 --> 00:32:27.341
Remembering
the opposing counsel's name already.

00:32:27.925 --> 00:32:30.887
I've heard plenty of things about you.

00:32:39.145 --> 00:32:41.064
This is a simple case,

00:32:41.147 --> 00:32:43.441
so let's not wear ourselves out.

00:32:44.275 --> 00:32:46.736
One person died in a closed space,

00:32:46.819 --> 00:32:50.406
and there was only one person
there at the time.

00:32:51.282 --> 00:32:53.785
That'll be clear
after further investigation.

00:32:58.498 --> 00:33:00.625
The only person
who had a master key to this house

00:33:00.708 --> 00:33:05.755
was the housekeeper,
and her alibi has already been confirmed.

00:33:06.422 --> 00:33:08.591
According to statements
from people around him,

00:33:08.674 --> 00:33:12.011
the only person who knew the door code

00:33:12.095 --> 00:33:14.639
was Mr. Do Ra-ik.

00:33:15.431 --> 00:33:18.017
And as you can see,
there's no sign of forced entry.

00:33:18.518 --> 00:33:19.977
Those crazy obsessive fangirls!

00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:21.854
They even broke into my house recently.

00:33:22.563 --> 00:33:25.900
Meaning, on that night,

00:33:27.193 --> 00:33:31.697
the only people in this place
were the victim and the suspect.

00:33:33.116 --> 00:33:36.577
I hear your client
is still claiming he's innocent.

00:33:36.661 --> 00:33:41.249
You and I both know how irrational

00:33:42.542 --> 00:33:43.793
and reckless that is.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.588
So try to convince him…

00:33:53.094 --> 00:33:55.054
So annoyed.

00:33:55.138 --> 00:33:56.556
It stinks.

00:33:57.723 --> 00:33:58.766
Kwak Byung-gyun

00:34:07.567 --> 00:34:09.694
That won't do for me.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:18.369
I'm the type who actually enjoys
doing irrational, crazy things.

00:34:20.997 --> 00:34:23.166
See you at the warrant hearing.

00:34:31.924 --> 00:34:34.093
Interesting.

00:34:35.761 --> 00:34:37.013
Are you crazy?

00:34:49.984 --> 00:34:51.152
I mean,

00:34:51.235 --> 00:34:54.530
even if you're Maeng Se-na
the lone-wolf hyena, this is too much!

00:34:54.614 --> 00:34:56.866
You do know Attorney Hwang
advises Goldie, right?

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:00.077
With the entertainment debating
whether to cut Do Ra-ik off,

00:35:00.161 --> 00:35:03.289
coming out with an innocence claim
from the same law firm is just--

00:35:03.372 --> 00:35:05.917
-Are you that afraid of Chief Kwak?
-Come on!

00:35:08.753 --> 00:35:09.629
Yes.

00:35:11.505 --> 00:35:15.635
Because of that snake of a man,
I had to endure all that humiliation…

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:19.388
You know exactly
why I turned down judgeships,

00:35:19.472 --> 00:35:22.642
prosecutor jobs, and every big law firm

00:35:22.725 --> 00:35:28.147
to join your tiny firm back when
you were barely surviving in Seocho.

00:35:31.234 --> 00:35:32.276
I don't know!

00:35:32.902 --> 00:35:35.279
You always bring that up
whenever things don't go your way.

00:35:35.363 --> 00:35:39.116
Kwak Jong-chul is going to twist this case
to his advantage again.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.786
He'll stir up the media,
get himself a friendly judge.

00:35:41.869 --> 00:35:44.080
And then, once again,
an innocent person will--

00:35:44.163 --> 00:35:46.999
No, I'm not listening!

00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:51.128
There are too many inconsistencies
in this case.

00:35:51.963 --> 00:35:54.215
I haven't seen the case files yet,
so it's not clear,

00:35:54.298 --> 00:35:55.800
but I'm certain there's something.

00:35:55.883 --> 00:35:59.011
Why are you so hung up on this case?

00:35:59.095 --> 00:36:00.554
Do you have some kind of certainty?

00:36:02.598 --> 00:36:03.557
I just…

00:36:04.684 --> 00:36:06.560
There's something
I want to check for myself.

00:36:11.607 --> 00:36:15.152
I don't know! I can't do anything to help.

00:36:15.236 --> 00:36:17.738
And if something goes wrong,
it's all on you, okay?

00:36:17.822 --> 00:36:18.823
Yes.

00:36:18.906 --> 00:36:21.117
You can talk just fine.

00:36:25.871 --> 00:36:26.831
What do you need?

00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:30.418
Nothing.

00:36:30.501 --> 00:36:33.838
Just keep giving me free rein,
stay out of my way

00:36:33.921 --> 00:36:36.090
like you always do,
and let me work however I want.

00:36:41.637 --> 00:36:43.764
Knock it off.
What are you here to gawk at?

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:47.435
The ones who can't work
always look for someone else's weakness.

00:36:48.144 --> 00:36:51.022
Ears perked up, hoping to catch something.

00:36:57.653 --> 00:37:00.614
You may have heard already,
I'll be handling Mr. Do Ra-ik's case.

00:37:00.698 --> 00:37:02.366
I need all related case files compiled.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:03.409
Sure.

00:37:13.252 --> 00:37:14.587
Come in.

00:37:20.468 --> 00:37:24.263
These are the notes
from Attorney Hwang's last meeting

00:37:24.347 --> 00:37:26.474
and the suspect's interview records.

00:37:26.557 --> 00:37:29.185
I thought they might be helpful.

00:37:33.314 --> 00:37:34.690
How did you get this?

00:37:34.774 --> 00:37:36.567
There's no way
he handed it over willingly.

00:37:39.779 --> 00:37:40.946
I stole it.

00:37:43.366 --> 00:37:44.825
I wanted to help.

00:37:46.369 --> 00:37:50.122
I'd like to become your legal assistant.

00:37:53.292 --> 00:37:56.670
I'm a fan of Gold Boys.

00:38:00.925 --> 00:38:02.093
Don't ever do this again.

00:38:02.176 --> 00:38:05.429
If something happens because of this,
I won't be able to protect you.

00:38:06.138 --> 00:38:07.973
-You can go now.
-Yes.

00:38:11.894 --> 00:38:13.062
Before the warrant hearing,

00:38:13.145 --> 00:38:16.732
we only have the suspect's testimony,
no investigation records, so it's tough.

00:38:17.858 --> 00:38:21.153
Find me similar cases or precedents
where a not-guilty claim was upheld.

00:38:21.237 --> 00:38:22.446
As many as you can.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:26.784
And you can sign the NDA
and put it on my desk by tomorrow.

00:38:26.867 --> 00:38:27.910
Yes!

00:38:48.389 --> 00:38:50.808
Hey, did you get Jin-taek's number?

00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:53.310
Almost, he's going live today.

00:38:53.394 --> 00:38:58.190
-I'm going to call him right then.
-Nice.

00:39:02.945 --> 00:39:06.198
You're Kim Hee-young, Choi Ha-neul, right?

00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:08.576
Who are you?

00:39:08.659 --> 00:39:10.786
Do we know you? Do you know this person?

00:39:12.955 --> 00:39:14.415
Hello, obsessive pests…

00:39:14.498 --> 00:39:17.042
I mean, obsessive fans. Nice to meet you.

00:39:17.126 --> 00:39:18.752
Mind if we have a little chat?

00:39:19.795 --> 00:39:23.507
-Who is she?
-I don't know.

00:39:27.636 --> 00:39:29.221
No, we are not!

00:39:29.305 --> 00:39:30.890
Too loud, you.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.893
We're not obsessive fans.

00:39:33.976 --> 00:39:36.937
We're TMB fans.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.773
Hands off! Record it!

00:39:39.857 --> 00:39:42.318
-Get out!
-I'll call the police!

00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:44.653
-Oppa!
-You still deny it?

00:39:44.737 --> 00:39:46.864
How could you do this to your fans?

00:39:46.947 --> 00:39:47.948
So what?

00:39:48.574 --> 00:39:52.578
Yeah, we snuck in, but he said it was fine
and told us to leave!

00:39:52.661 --> 00:39:54.497
Things are not fine anymore.

00:39:55.122 --> 00:39:58.667
A murder took place
in the very place you trespassed into.

00:39:58.751 --> 00:40:00.836
And I don't think
those two events are unrelated.

00:40:04.256 --> 00:40:06.008
What is she talking about?

00:40:06.091 --> 00:40:08.928
That day Woo-seong ended up like that,

00:40:09.011 --> 00:40:11.430
-we were tailing the TMB boys.
-Right.

00:40:12.139 --> 00:40:13.933
How did you even find us?

00:40:14.016 --> 00:40:18.103
Is it okay for you
to go after unrelated people like this?

00:40:18.187 --> 00:40:20.105
Well, whether there's a connection or not

00:40:20.189 --> 00:40:22.691
can change a lot
depending on the angle you look from.

00:40:24.568 --> 00:40:28.155
Not reporting it
doesn't make your crime any lighter.

00:40:28.239 --> 00:40:32.117
Being fans doesn't mean
you get to do whatever you want.

00:40:32.785 --> 00:40:36.080
And I fully intend to make you understand

00:40:36.163 --> 00:40:38.791
just how serious your actions were.

00:40:40.709 --> 00:40:43.712
You've seen how this case
shows up in real-time headlines

00:40:43.796 --> 00:40:45.506
every morning and night, right?

00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:47.841
With the case blowing up like this,

00:40:47.925 --> 00:40:51.679
what do you think will happen
when reporters find out

00:40:51.762 --> 00:40:54.181
two people trespassed
into Mr. Do Ra-ik's house?

00:40:56.475 --> 00:40:58.352
They'll love it, right?

00:40:59.728 --> 00:41:04.692
I'll file the lawsuits one at a time,
at a very slow pace

00:41:04.775 --> 00:41:07.236
and watch the attention grow even bigger.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.116
Then it won't be him appearing on TV
in real time anymore.

00:41:12.199 --> 00:41:14.285
It'll be you guys.

00:41:14.368 --> 00:41:16.996
And the forums will go crazy
digging up your information.

00:41:18.122 --> 00:41:19.582
People will be curious.

00:41:19.665 --> 00:41:22.835
Like, who are these girls,

00:41:22.918 --> 00:41:26.714
and how were they sneaking in and out
of his house without anyone noticing?

00:41:26.797 --> 00:41:29.174
-And how did they know the passcode?
-It's not…

00:41:31.218 --> 00:41:32.803
I wasn't asking you to answer.

00:41:33.387 --> 00:41:36.932
All I have to do is sit back and wait.

00:41:39.893 --> 00:41:43.689
The reporters will get
all the answers for me anyway.

00:41:44.231 --> 00:41:45.899
Relentlessly.

00:41:49.862 --> 00:41:50.696
Excuse me!

00:41:53.574 --> 00:41:56.577
We only went there
because someone told us about it.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.329
It was just curiosity.

00:42:02.291 --> 00:42:03.125
How?

00:42:04.627 --> 00:42:05.628
It's…

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:14.595
The security guards switch shifts
from 11:50 p.m. to 12:00 a.m.

00:42:19.308 --> 00:42:21.018
That's when we go in.

00:42:23.562 --> 00:42:26.273
We already know
all the CCTV locations anyway,

00:42:26.357 --> 00:42:29.401
so avoiding them is a piece of cake.

00:42:46.627 --> 00:42:49.296
We just wait for the right moment,
and when the door opens, bam!

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.508
We slip in, and that's it. Game over.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.265
Because of resident privacy,

00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:02.768
there are no CCTVs
in the hallways or stairwells.

00:43:15.864 --> 00:43:19.910
And the last step is waiting on the stairs
with the motion-sensor light disabled.

00:43:19.993 --> 00:43:23.288
If it turns on by accident, we're screwed.

00:43:24.456 --> 00:43:27.418
So we set everything up
before Ra-ik gets home and wait.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.046
That way, we can safely watch
and figure out the passcode.

00:43:38.804 --> 00:43:42.558
Once we get the passcode,
we wait for a day he's out

00:43:42.641 --> 00:43:45.644
and the housekeeper's off, then we go in.

00:43:45.728 --> 00:43:47.646
As long as he doesn't change the code,

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:50.023
we can come and go whenever we want,

00:43:50.691 --> 00:43:52.276
as long as we don't get caught.

00:43:54.945 --> 00:43:56.739
You two are real professionals.

00:43:57.865 --> 00:44:00.993
So after figuring out
the passcode to his place,

00:44:01.577 --> 00:44:04.496
you went back on another day,
snuck into his house

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.914
and he caught you?

00:44:05.998 --> 00:44:08.792
-That day, you filmed the video of him?
-Yes.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.087
It's because he called us cockroaches.

00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:13.756
-Right?
-Yes.

00:44:15.299 --> 00:44:16.300
But…

00:44:16.884 --> 00:44:19.136
Did he really kill Woo-seong?

00:44:19.219 --> 00:44:21.972
That's your big question, you stalker?

00:44:22.055 --> 00:44:24.349
I told you, we're not stalkers!

00:44:24.933 --> 00:44:27.644
We did it because we love him!

00:44:28.854 --> 00:44:30.606
Isn't that what love is?

00:44:30.689 --> 00:44:34.443
Wanting to get closer,
wanting to see him,

00:44:34.526 --> 00:44:36.653
-wanting to take care of him more.
-No.

00:44:37.279 --> 00:44:39.281
That's not love. That's hunting.

00:44:40.115 --> 00:44:41.241
Because it was fun,

00:44:41.325 --> 00:44:44.203
threatening someone's life
and making them suffer.

00:44:44.286 --> 00:44:45.245
Violently.

00:44:46.914 --> 00:44:50.501
If you truly loved him,
you could never do something like that.

00:44:55.547 --> 00:44:57.382
Real love is…

00:45:00.594 --> 00:45:05.098
watching the path he walks
from far, far away…

00:45:06.975 --> 00:45:08.352
supporting him,

00:45:09.853 --> 00:45:11.438
and wishing

00:45:12.523 --> 00:45:14.107
for his happiness…

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.694
with all your heart.

00:45:17.778 --> 00:45:19.571
Bring him back to life!

00:45:19.655 --> 00:45:21.698
-Bring him back!
-Bring him back!

00:45:21.782 --> 00:45:24.409
Execute Do Ra-ik!

00:45:24.493 --> 00:45:25.911
-Execute him!
-Execute him!

00:45:35.963 --> 00:45:39.341
-Here he comes!
-Just say one word!

00:45:39.424 --> 00:45:41.385
How do you feel right now?

00:45:41.468 --> 00:45:42.970
Keep your head up.

00:45:43.053 --> 00:45:44.263
COURT

00:45:46.348 --> 00:45:49.017
You look like guilty
if you keep your head down.

00:45:49.643 --> 00:45:51.645
Lift your head, and stand tall.

00:45:54.064 --> 00:45:54.898
I don't know.

00:45:57.568 --> 00:45:58.902
I don't remember.

00:46:01.196 --> 00:46:03.198
No matter how hard I try,
I can't remember.

00:46:06.159 --> 00:46:07.452
It wasn't me.

00:46:09.204 --> 00:46:10.497
It really wasn't.

00:46:14.167 --> 00:46:15.586
But what if it was?

00:46:17.254 --> 00:46:19.548
What if I was the one
who did that to Woo-seong…

00:46:20.591 --> 00:46:21.883
Mr. Do Ra-ik.

00:46:24.636 --> 00:46:25.554
Mr. Do Ra-ik.

00:46:31.643 --> 00:46:33.562
As long as I'm representing you,

00:46:33.645 --> 00:46:35.981
you will be found innocent.

00:46:36.064 --> 00:46:38.358
I'll make sure of it. Understood?

00:46:40.652 --> 00:46:43.989
So repeat after me, "I, Do Ra-ik."

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.161
I said repeat after me, "I, Do Ra-ik."

00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:51.538
I, Do Ra-ik.

00:46:52.289 --> 00:46:55.083
"Did not kill Kang Woo-seong."

00:47:00.088 --> 00:47:01.923
Did not kill Kang Woo-seong.

00:47:02.007 --> 00:47:06.094
"I do not admit to killing
Kang Woo-seong."

00:47:07.804 --> 00:47:12.309
I do not admit to killing Kang Woo-seong.

00:47:16.563 --> 00:47:18.815
Counsel, please state your position.

00:47:26.448 --> 00:47:27.699
Your Honor,

00:47:27.783 --> 00:47:31.244
the prosecution's sole basis
for labeling the defendant a murderer

00:47:31.328 --> 00:47:36.917
is just one claim that no third party
entered the scene of the crime.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.170
However, two weeks before the incident,

00:47:40.253 --> 00:47:43.048
the defendant was the victim
of an illegal home intrusion

00:47:43.131 --> 00:47:44.758
committed by obsessive fans.

00:47:44.841 --> 00:47:49.096
Because of his status as a public figure,
an official police report was not filed,

00:47:49.179 --> 00:47:52.015
but the fact of the illegal intrusion
by obsessive fans

00:47:52.099 --> 00:47:54.935
has already been sufficiently
and objectively proven.

00:47:55.018 --> 00:47:56.561
Therefore, the prosecution's premise

00:47:56.645 --> 00:47:58.689
that no third party entered the residence

00:47:58.772 --> 00:48:00.565
has effectively lost
its credibility, and--

00:48:00.649 --> 00:48:02.067
That claim is unverified.

00:48:02.984 --> 00:48:06.071
It's the prosecution
that is making unverified claims.

00:48:07.906 --> 00:48:10.033
Your Honor, the prosecution has stated

00:48:10.117 --> 00:48:13.495
that all forensic processing
of the defendant's home is complete.

00:48:13.578 --> 00:48:15.831
But according to the warrant application,

00:48:15.914 --> 00:48:18.250
there is no mention whatsoever
of the weapon presumed

00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:21.211
to have been used in the crime.

00:48:21.712 --> 00:48:24.423
Prosecutor,
do you have an explanation for this?

00:48:24.506 --> 00:48:25.966
Regarding that,

00:48:26.049 --> 00:48:28.176
it's still under investigation.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:29.928
I can't disclose any specific details.

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:35.183
But the forensic results show
that there were no signs of external--

00:48:35.267 --> 00:48:37.894
Your Honor,
on the night of the incident,

00:48:37.978 --> 00:48:41.022
record-breaking heavy rain
began to fall at midnight.

00:48:41.106 --> 00:48:44.609
Therefore, the possibility that traces
of an intrusion were erased by the rain

00:48:44.693 --> 00:48:46.987
-must be carefully reconsidered.
-Your Honor,

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:49.614
the defense is engaging
in baseless speculation.

00:48:49.698 --> 00:48:53.410
It is the prosecution's responsibility
to prove whether it is speculation or not.

00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:58.123
According to the defendant's
interrogation record,

00:48:58.206 --> 00:49:01.042
they repeatedly questioned him
with things like,

00:49:01.126 --> 00:49:03.462
"There were signs
that the place had been searched.

00:49:03.545 --> 00:49:05.589
What exactly were you looking for?"

00:49:05.672 --> 00:49:10.594
This means the presence of search traces
at the scene cannot be excluded.

00:49:11.678 --> 00:49:13.388
In general, search traces

00:49:13.472 --> 00:49:17.476
are marks left when an offender is trying
to find or hide a particular item.

00:49:17.559 --> 00:49:21.146
So they can serve as strong evidence
that someone other than the defendant,

00:49:21.229 --> 00:49:25.650
specifically, someone unfamiliar
with the space

00:49:25.734 --> 00:49:28.612
was present at the crime scene.

00:49:28.695 --> 00:49:32.324
Prosecutor, was any such trace
found at the scene?

00:49:36.286 --> 00:49:38.163
Yes, there was.

00:49:39.998 --> 00:49:41.625
Your Honor,

00:49:41.708 --> 00:49:44.002
under the fundamental principles
of criminal procedure,

00:49:44.085 --> 00:49:48.465
a guilty verdict must be based on evidence
that leaves no room for reasonable doubt.

00:49:49.049 --> 00:49:51.718
Therefore, since the prosecution
has failed to present

00:49:51.802 --> 00:49:54.179
any clear evidence proving
the defendant's alleged crime,

00:49:54.262 --> 00:49:59.059
the request for an arrest warrant
to detain the defendant must be denied.

00:50:00.268 --> 00:50:02.062
Accordingly,

00:50:02.145 --> 00:50:05.190
based on the presumption of innocence,
the defense strongly urges

00:50:05.273 --> 00:50:07.526
that the defendant not be detained.

00:50:17.077 --> 00:50:18.161
That stings.

00:50:22.165 --> 00:50:25.418
You're throwing counterpunches
from the very first round.

00:50:25.502 --> 00:50:26.336
Pardon?

00:50:29.422 --> 00:50:30.549
A counterpunch

00:50:31.967 --> 00:50:34.094
is when you strike back
against an incoming attack.

00:50:34.678 --> 00:50:37.013
I didn't really see anything
I'd call an attack.

00:50:37.097 --> 00:50:38.932
So that was just a couple of jabs?

00:50:39.015 --> 00:50:40.267
That's right.

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:41.935
Compare them next time,

00:50:42.018 --> 00:50:44.563
how a jab differs from a counterpunch.

00:50:45.939 --> 00:50:47.691
I'm going to knock you out then.

00:51:02.372 --> 00:51:04.875
How do you overlook
something that important?

00:51:04.958 --> 00:51:08.712
If they didn't report it,
how would I know?

00:51:09.337 --> 00:51:13.091
-This just got complicated, seriously.
-It's fine.

00:51:13.174 --> 00:51:16.011
It was just a blank.
It fired, so that's good enough.

00:51:20.015 --> 00:51:21.349
He talks well.

00:51:39.743 --> 00:51:41.995
The results will come out later.

00:51:43.455 --> 00:51:46.666
You can go home now
since the forensic work is done.

00:51:48.335 --> 00:51:51.004
Do you have anyone to contact?
Someone you trust.

00:51:51.087 --> 00:51:52.714
I'll have them come pick you up.

00:52:03.183 --> 00:52:07.228
The arrest warrant for singer Do Ra-ik
has been dismissed.

00:52:07.312 --> 00:52:10.899
In today's closed warrant review hearing,

00:52:10.982 --> 00:52:15.654
the court determined that he doesn't pose
a risk of destroying evidence or fleeing.

00:52:16.196 --> 00:52:18.907
As a result of this decision,
he will remain out of custody

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:21.743
as the investigation continues.

00:52:21.826 --> 00:52:24.412
However, the case is not over yet.

00:52:24.496 --> 00:52:29.125
The prosecution is working
to secure additional evidence

00:52:29.209 --> 00:52:33.004
to determine the cause of Kang's death
and to uncover the full circumstances…

00:52:53.608 --> 00:52:54.776
Pull over for a moment.

00:53:32.605 --> 00:53:34.816
MURDERER

00:54:45.512 --> 00:54:48.640
Why are you being like that to Jae-hee?

00:54:49.224 --> 00:54:51.184
He cares about you so much.

00:54:51.267 --> 00:54:53.019
But why doesn't he call me?

00:54:53.603 --> 00:54:56.648
It's not that he doesn't like you.
Just hurry up and open it.

00:54:56.731 --> 00:54:57.774
-Hungry, right?
-Yes.

00:54:58.608 --> 00:55:01.736
I'm going in first!

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.977
-You still can't stay on pitch.
-Then you do it.

00:56:21.441 --> 00:56:23.776
You try it.

00:56:26.154 --> 00:56:29.365
Come on, I searched so much for it…

00:56:30.074 --> 00:56:32.202
I've got this.

00:56:34.078 --> 00:56:37.081
I told you it's not.

00:56:37.165 --> 00:56:39.626
-Isn't this how it's supposed to be done?
-No.

00:56:46.591 --> 00:56:50.178
-You have to lift your pinky!
-All right.

00:56:50.261 --> 00:56:51.804
I'll try again.

00:57:58.121 --> 00:57:59.080
Did you wake up?

00:58:01.708 --> 00:58:04.752
That's a relief.
I thought you might not wake up.

00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:09.632
It's good to see you again,

00:58:10.925 --> 00:58:12.260
Mr. Do Ra-ik.

00:58:12.844 --> 00:58:14.345
Welcome…

00:58:17.307 --> 00:58:18.349
to my home.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.032
I'm Do Ra-ik's lawyer right now.

00:59:16.115 --> 00:59:18.117
I have to protect my client to the end.

00:59:18.743 --> 00:59:20.536
Is that really the only reason?

00:59:21.245 --> 00:59:22.580
Ugh, Maeng-byeon, seriously.

00:59:22.664 --> 00:59:23.748
Aren't you scared?

00:59:23.831 --> 00:59:24.707
Punish Do Ra-ik.

00:59:24.791 --> 00:59:27.502
Given the distance, you should have been
back within 20 minutes at the latest.

00:59:27.585 --> 00:59:30.338
You're hiding something from me, right?
What is it?

00:59:30.421 --> 00:59:31.631
Will you even trust me?

00:59:31.714 --> 00:59:33.091
Until the end.

00:59:33.591 --> 00:59:35.301
I'll stay by your side.

00:59:35.385 --> 00:59:37.136
I will find my memory back somehow.

00:59:38.054 --> 00:59:39.263
No matter what.

00:59:40.598 --> 00:59:45.603
