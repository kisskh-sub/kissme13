00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:15.940
Go!

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.000
Retreat! Let's go!

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.340
Take everything!

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.560
All transport operations suspended?

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.270
We have no choice.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:07.730
Master Sanhe,

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:08.810
I understand.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.130
For the past two years, your men
have been mostly transporting

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.340
supplies for the Resistance,

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.370
earning just a little hard-earned money

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.440
to barely get by.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.010
Once transport operations stop,

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.540
your men will have a hard time
making a living.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.550
If there are difficulties...

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.630
Money isn't what I'm concerned about.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.840
No matter how tough
things get for our men,

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.370
they won't starve to death.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.920
What I'm worried about is

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.290
this large shipment of tungsten ore
that just arrived.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:30.600
We had agreed

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.770
to exchange it

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.860
for the shipment

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.390
of diesel fuel
that Rodrigues brought into

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:34.980
Macau.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.870
Once transport operations stop,

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.180
with such important cargo stuck in hand

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.300
and the Japanese inspecting so strictly,

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.670
if time drags on,

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.200
I'm afraid information might leak

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.340
and cause trouble.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.980
It's precisely because this cargo is
so important

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.680
that without the Guerrilla Unit's escort,

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.210
the risk is simply too high.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.370
That's right.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:55.170
Master Sanhe,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.960
we'll have to ask you

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.530
to find a way to hide
this batch of goods for now.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.180
Alright.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.290
I'll return to Zhongshan overnight

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.580
and hide the tungsten ore
in the Xi River first,

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.180
so the Japanese won't find it.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.840
The most important thing right now

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.770
isn't the cargo,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.880
but...

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.430
how to help Captain Ou and his men

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.830
get through this crisis.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:12.940
Indeed.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.510
The encrypted telegram
from the Guerrilla Unit says

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.770
that dozens of wounded guerrillas
can't move with the team,

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.340
especially the critically injured.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.980
They urgently need surgery now,

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.510
but Zhongshan doesn't have
the necessary conditions.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:23.840
They are asking if we in Macau

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.170
can think of a solution.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.870
Dr. Ke,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.750
aren't the operating rooms
at Kiang Wu Hospital

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.060
ready for use?

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.180
The surgical equipment is all in place,

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.460
but the application to open
the operating rooms

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.860
is still being held up
by the Health Bureau.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.590
Why is it being held up
by the Health Bureau?

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.960
The Portuguese Macau government has long
discriminated against Chinese doctors.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.820
The Health Bureau has regulations

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.530
that in Macau,

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.870
only certified

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:47.060
Portuguese surgeons

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.870
are qualified to perform surgeries.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.820
Chinese doctors can't perform surgeries
without authorization.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.480
We need approval from the Health Bureau,

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.840
which then reports to
the Executive Council.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.930
In short, there are piles of procedures,

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.930
and approval won't come for months.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.270
Those damn foreigners.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.350
The situation is urgent now.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.940
We don't have time to wait for them

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.740
to go through their procedures.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:04.840
I'll go back immediately and mobilize

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.510
all medical staff

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.220
to jointly petition the Governor

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.300
for urgent special authorization to allow
Kiang Wu Hospital to perform surgery.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.170
Once the surgical authorization is
approved,

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.250
Master Sanhe, I hope you

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.780
can transport the wounded
to Macau promptly.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.060
You can count on me.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:16:59.950
Water Ghost?

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.050
Water Ghost!

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:04.200
Mr. Liang.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.520
Mr. Liang.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:07.569
Weren't you supposed to
be watching the door?

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.020
Why are you sneaking around alone
in the warehouse?

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:10.569
Hey!

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.410
Are you secretly smoking opium again?

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:14.869
No.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.400
Absolutely not, Mr. Liang.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.700
I can barely afford food these days.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.500
How would I have money for opium?

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.089
I was just a bit sleepy,

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.000
so I came in here to take a nap.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.869
It'd better be.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.280
If the Leader finds out

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.810
you've been secretly smoking opium again,

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.290
he'll skin you alive.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.440
Go watch the door now.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.280
Okay, okay.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:33.380
Hey, wait.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.990
Come here.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:38.970
Water Ghost,

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.170
recently,

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.560
we haven't had any transport jobs.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.350
Nobody's making money,

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.220
and you've always been a big spender.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:46.650
Here.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.500
Take the money.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.760
But don't you dare use it for opium.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.330
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.060
Don't worry.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.960
I quit a long time ago.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:56.870
Hurry up and watch the door.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.330
I'll check the inventory.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.610
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:01.140
Alright.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.520
[Yayue Tea House]

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:42.810
Boss,

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.590
at black market prices,

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.720
one box of this is worth half a gold bar.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.150
Three boxes should be enough
for three months' worth of opium, right?

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.350
-Yes.
-Then hurry up.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:52.260
Get going.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.080
What's the rush?

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.250
Well.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.000
It's penicillin.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.240
American-made.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.110
Military grade too.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:13.940
Water Ghost.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.810
You're quite something.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.150
Tell me.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.520
Where did you get

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.370
such good stuff?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.560
Such a massive amount of tungsten ore

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.000
is hidden in Zhongshan?

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.300
But knowing that doesn't help us.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.090
Only the top leaders

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.730
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood know
the location of the goods.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.670
How are we supposed to
find it in such a large county?

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.020
We can't find the tungsten ore
in Zhongshan,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.970
but the diesel fuel that Rodrigues
was going to use for the exchange

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.280
is still in Macau, isn't it?

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.070
But now all their supply lines
have been shut down,

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.800
so Rodrigues's diesel

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.570
won't be moved either.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.960
That's why we need

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.440
you, Mr. Consul, to step in

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.980
and force them to move it.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.090
Our Macau government has just received

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.390
an urgent diplomatic note

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.930
from Yasumitsu Fukae.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.110
Due to the recent increase
in smuggling here,

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.280
the Japanese authorities

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.520
have stated that they will

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.070
launch

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.350
a joint anti-smuggling operation here
immediately.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.960
What does that have to do with the diesel
I'm asking for?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.810
Consul Reeve,

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:32.480
you should know

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.310
that Japan has

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.070
joint anti-smuggling authority
throughout Macau.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.440
According to their requirements,

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.170
during the inspection period,

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.740
all commercial maritime transport
must be suspended here.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.890
All businesses must

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.780
declare their entire inventory
within three days.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.180
After that,

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.900
the Joint Anti-Smuggling Team will conduct

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.770
a thorough inspection throughout the city.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.040
Any undeclared goods discovered

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.260
will be deemed contraband.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.330
The Joint Anti-Smuggling Team
has the authority to seize the goods

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.520
and immediately arrest all personnel

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.520
involved on site.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.240
Now that the Japanese
have surrounded Zhongshan,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.570
we cannot transport

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.940
this diesel out at all
under such a tight blockade.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.020
If we don't declare it

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.570
and it's discovered during inspection,

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.200
with the Macau government involved,

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.780
this will become a serious problem.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.890
What I mean is,

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.020
we can only

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.440
completely abandon this batch of diesel.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.970
We can arrange
other sources of diesel later.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:26.540
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.930
are you joking?

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.350
Hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops
are attacking Hunan,

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.150
Guangxi, and northern Guangdong.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.680
This diesel is meant to supply

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.150
British military service units

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.070
and American observation units
across those regions.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.730
Our units are now in Shaoguan,

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:40.930
Guilin,

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.170
and Huizhou.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.590
This diesel is intended for
their emergency evacuation.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.040
If we abandon this batch of diesel,

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.670
and as a result, our Allied Forces'

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.440
service units and observation units

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.430
aren't able to evacuate in time,

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.090
who among you
can take responsibility for that?

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.370
But isn't there simply
no other option right now?

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.440
Who would have thought

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.390
that the Japanese would exploit
the shutdown of Macau's transport routes

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.650
to suddenly conduct an inspection on us?

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:03.670
Consul Reeve,

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.460
this time we must ask you

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.280
to understand
the Macau government's predicament.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.330
Governor,

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.110
I cannot understand at all!

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.040
You may fear the Japanese at present,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.610
but please don't forget

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.540
that on both the European
and Pacific fronts,

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.670
our British and American Allied Forces
are continuously achieving victories.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:24.150
The outcome of this war
has already been determined.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.000
And both Macau and Portugal

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.590
should be well aware of

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.890
how the situation in the Far East
will unfold in the near future.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.430
When that time comes,

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.410
Britain and America
will never forgive those

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:36.670
who undermined us behind our backs.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.250
In short,

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.200
the Governor has already promised
Consul Reeve

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.200
that this batch of diesel
must be shipped out immediately.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.610
But during the inspection period,

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.650
aren't all merchant vessels
prohibited from leaving port?

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.670
We're planning

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.570
to use the Steamship Sai On.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:54.690
You should know

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.240
that Macau's daily supply
has always depended on Guangdong.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.520
During the inspection
and port closure period,

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.980
the government needs to
send ships to Zhongshan

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.110
to purchase essential supplies.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.200
That is perfectly reasonable, isn't it?

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.800
And we've already confirmed

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:07.650
that as long as

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.350
a leading figure
from Macau's business community

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:11.850
acts as guarantor for the ship rental,

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:12.830
the Japanese Naval Defense Department

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.500
will allow the government to handle

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.090
special transit permits
for official vessels.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.180
So you want to use

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.070
the Steamship Sai On,

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.410
under the pretext of purchasing supplies,

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.210
to smuggle that batch of diesel?

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:26.280
There's no other way.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.070
I'll act as the ship rental guarantor.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.220
The GEB will apply to the Japanese
for the transit permit.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.980
Xian, all we need you to do

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.440
is activate the transport line
to Zhongshan

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.960
and notify Huang Sanhe
to receive the goods on time.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.310
We can also bring back

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.090
the tungsten ore urgently needed
by the Allied Forces.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.700
This plan kills two birds with one stone.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:46.510
No.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.010
This is far too risky.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.130
The leader of the Portuguese merchants is
shipping the cargo,

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.780
and the GEB is
applying for the transit permit.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.260
If anything goes wrong

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.720
and the Japanese find out,

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.260
it would mean the Portuguese merchants
and the government

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.990
are jointly transporting
strategic materials.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.500
Mr. He, aren't you overthinking this?

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.150
Precisely because the government
cannot smuggle,

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.520
even if the Japanese
are extremely suspicious,

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.980
they wouldn't suspect
the Steamship Sai On.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.980
The deadline for inventory declarations
is today.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.930
This diesel must be transported out,

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.330
whether we like it or not.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:22.260
Let's put aside
the diesel transportation matter for now.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.650
I'd like to ask first:

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.020
the application for surgical authorization
at Kiang Wu Hospital

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.890
was submitted several days ago.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.130
Why hasn't it been

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:30.440
approved yet?

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:31.680
What?

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.180
A simple surgical authorization,

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.830
and it still hasn't been approved?

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.170
It's because the Governor has been

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.960
overwhelmed by that batch of diesel

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.490
and simply hasn't had time.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.810
Once the diesel matter is resolved,

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:42.780
all other matters

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.670
will be handled promptly.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.520
I understand.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.820
Since you insist on transporting it,

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.630
I have one condition.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.330
Why would He Xian

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.700
volunteer to be the guarantor
for the Steamship Sai On?

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.760
His reasoning is that it's too risky

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:09.580
if only Portuguese merchants
and the government are involved.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.000
If something goes wrong,
it would be catastrophic for Macau.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.610
He's the chairman
of the Banking Association

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.090
and also a representative figure
of Macau's business community.

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.460
If he acts as the guarantor,
once something goes wrong,

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.630
the government can shift responsibility
to him personally.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:21.780
In that case, I'll approve

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.150
his request for Kiang Wu Hospital's
surgical authorization.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.240
No, Your Excellency,

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.590
you absolutely cannot approve
that surgical authorization now.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.420
Why not?

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.650
Your Excellency,

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:32.430
why is He Xian

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.370
so eager to open Kiang Wu Hospital's
operating rooms?

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:39.240
It's just to treat
Ou Xin's wounded guerrillas.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.110
Once you sign the special approval,

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.590
large numbers of
wounded Communist guerrillas

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.030
will be sent to Macau for surgery.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.960
What if the Japanese find out about this?

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.390
Macau would still be accused of
violating neutrality

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.370
and secretly aiding
the resistance against Japan.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.510
Then how do we explain this to He Xian?

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.720
There's only one way—stall.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.980
The Health Bureau
already has clear regulations:

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.570
only Portuguese doctors are qualified to
perform surgeries.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:05.650
We can simply say
that Kiang Wu Hospital isn't ready yet

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:09.030
and stall
until the diesel shipment is dispatched.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.090
But how can we face He Xian if we do this?

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.520
Between an individual and the government,

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.390
Your Excellency,

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:19.350
the choice is very clear.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:32.890
Hello?

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:35.540
Oh, Dr. Ke.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.890
I was just about to go to the government
to process the ship charter guarantee.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.620
How are things at the hospital?

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.680
What?

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.040
Rejected?

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:45.910
Yes.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.540
We've already received the official reply
from the Health Bureau.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.130
They said that Chinese doctors in Macau
are not qualified to perform surgeries

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.330
and rejected the hospital's application
for surgical authorization.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:55.630
How could they do that?

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.810
Aren't they going back on their word?

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.940
Everyone at the hospital is
extremely upset now.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.020
All the doctors want to resign in protest.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.750
I can't hold them back on my own.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.090
I've already notified Wanqi to come
as soon as possible as the representative

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.720
of the Kiang Wu Charitable Association
and try to calm everyone.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.390
Alright.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.190
I understand.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.520
I'm going to the Government House now.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.450
Wait for my news.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.860
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.330
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:28.390
The Japanese army carried out
an atrocity at Shimen Jiubao, Zhongshan!

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.980
Forty-one villagers were buried alive!

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.720
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.220
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.220
The Japanese army carried out
an atrocity at Shimen Jiubao, Zhongshan!

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.670
Forty-one villagers were buried alive!

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.140
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.770
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.430
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.110
An atrocity at Shimen Jiubao!

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:49.870
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.330
Kid, I'd like a copy.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:52.630
Ming.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.780
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.580
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.870
Guys, hurry up!

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.460
Mr. Liang.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.720
Hey, Young Master Huang.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.090
I've already marked the meeting points

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.150
on the map.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.130
From now on,

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.670
all crew members are forbidden
to leave the ship without permission.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.310
Our men helping to load cargo

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.110
also cannot act on their own,

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.460
to prevent any leaks.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:26.570
Don't worry.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.430
I'll only hand the map to the captain
after the ship passes

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.230
the Japanese checkpoint
on the Xi River tomorrow.

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.130
Good. I'll leave things
in your hands then.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.660
Alright.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.670
Everyone, hurry up!

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.280
Your obstruction and self-preservation

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.810
are why the wounded are stranded
at Black Hill

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.280
without medical treatment.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.240
And that's why those innocent villagers,

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.890
who risked their lives
to protect the wounded,

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.290
were brutally murdered.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.910
Forty-one people.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:02.950
Forty-one Chinese lives!

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.660
Mr. He.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.610
The Japanese have gone to such extremes.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.540
That is truly something

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:11.190
we never imagined.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.290
But the tragedy,

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.850
after all, was caused by the Japanese.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:15.800
But then again,

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.090
Ou Xin and his band of guerrillas

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.720
will eventually be wiped out
by the Japanese.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.380
For Macau's sake,
the government has no choice.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:27.000
Since the Chinese will lose
to the Japanese anyway,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.150
helping the Guerrilla Unit even

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.000
a little bit isn't worth it.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.390
But transporting diesel
for the British and Americans,

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.240
no matter how risky, is worth it.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.100
That's your logic,

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:36.940
isn't it?

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.460
Mr. He, I understand you're angry,

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.420
but this is reality.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.330
Macau can't afford to offend Japan now,

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.200
and in the future,

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.830
we certainly can't afford to offend
the British and Americans either.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.500
Do you know why?

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.460
It's all because Macau is weak.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.600
We can only accept all this.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:56.520
Mr. He,

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.840
I have some advice for you.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.420
The course of the global war

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.890
is already very clear.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.330
The victory of
the British and American Allied Forces

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.610
is just a matter of time.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:06.570
You're a businessman.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.930
Surely you understand better than we do

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.650
the principle of
seeking profit and avoiding harm.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.460
Regarding the Guerrilla Unit,
we can only endure for now.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.630
This isn't just for Macau,

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.560
but also a necessary way
for you to protect yourself.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.810
And helping transport this shipment
of diesel for Britain and America

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.150
is laying the groundwork for the future.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.870
When the Japanese are driven away

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:26.910
and Britain and America return,

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:28.170
who will remember

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.230
that small guerrilla unit
eliminated by the Japanese?

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.350
The British and Americans

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.940
will only remember that you were the one

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:38.910
who helped them

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:40.500
at the critical moment.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.560
Mr. He.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.890
The diesel is being loaded.
All that's left is your signature.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.820
As for other people and matters...

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.910
please don't invite trouble.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:06.040
Please.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:08.960
I'm sorry.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.180
Putting profit before principles

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.110
is something I, He Xian,
never learned growing up

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.840
and will never do in the future.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:15.830
I will not sign

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.220
this guarantee.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.630
And I will not participate

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.510
in this SS Sai On Plan either.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:23.910
Moreover,

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.040
not just this time—

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.500
from this point on, we Chinese merchants

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.430
will no longer

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:32.670
cooperate with your government
in any of its affairs.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.760
Let me give you a piece of advice too.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.700
If you only see profit

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.090
and ignore righteousness,

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:01.150
you'll eventually reap what you sow.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:45.930
Xian.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:46.500
Xian.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.470
How did it go with the government?

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:51.730
President He.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.000
Did the government refuse to
change its decision?

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.700
If that's the case,

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.460
all of us in the medical department

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.920
have a difficult request.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.610
We hope you understand.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.810
If you all want to resign collectively

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.040
as a form of protest,

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.810
as the acting President of the Board
of the Kiang Wu Charitable Association,

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:18.600
I, He Xian,

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.180
will be the first to sign.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.280
Xian, what are you doing?

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:21.720
Xian.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.120
Let's talk about this...

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.630
See for yourselves.

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:02.080
We personally promised He Xian

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:04.220
the surgical authorization
for Kiang Wu Hospital.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.870
Why go back on your word?

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.350
Exactly. He Xian just called both of us.

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:10.750
He's backing out of
the Steamship Sai On plan

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.710
and told us to withdraw quickly too.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:13.850
What should we do now?

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:16.250
If He Xian backs out, we still have you.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.870
As long as you act as the guarantor,

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.000
the SS Sai On Plan can proceed
as normal, right?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.690
But He Xian repeatedly warned us

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.710
that having only us Portuguese handle this

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.350
is too risky.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.620
Don't listen to his alarmist talk.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.100
The SS Sai On is a government vessel.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.330
With proper transit permits,

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.540
who would be suspicious?

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.190
Besides, from the beginning of loading,

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:39.730
I've specifically deployed
additional police forces

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:41.100
throughout the entire pier
to strengthen security.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.060
There's no way
the information could leak out.

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.300
Mr. Rodrigues,

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.440
this shipment of diesel is
under your name after all,

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.770
and the declaration deadline
has already passed.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.120
If we don't ship it now,

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.870
once the Japanese discover it,

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:54.480
you'll be the one charged with smuggling.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:55.659
But...

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:56.889
There are no "buts."

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:58.390
The cargo is already loaded on the ship.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.730
We're just waiting for the paperwork.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.790
What are you still hesitating about?

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.930
Put some muscle into it!

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:27.530
Water Ghost?

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.330
-Water Ghost, are you alright?
-Mr. Liang!

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.590
-Quick!
-Water Ghost.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:31.800
Are you alright?

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:32.860
My hand slipped,

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:34.100
so I bumped into something.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:34.810
Are you badly injured?

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:36.390
Do you need to see a doctor?

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.790
It's nothing, Mr. Liang.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:39.290
Didn't Master Huang say

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:40.750
that today,

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:42.610
none of us can leave here?

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:43.160
Quick,

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:43.890
get up first.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:44.930
I can bear it.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.540
I can still continue working,

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.100
Mr. Liang.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.100
Let me take a look.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.690
He probably injured the bone.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:53.700
Well then.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.090
I'll send someone

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.530
to take you to a doctor.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.170
No need, Mr. Liang.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.850
I can't let the others

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:03.010
break the rules because of me.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:04.260
Alright.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:05.910
That's good too.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:06.840
Take this money

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.060
with you.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:08.960
Mr. Liang,

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:10.730
I can't take your money again.

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.380
What's mine is yours.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.140
Fei,

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.100
help him off the ship.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:14.980
O-Okay.

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:18.390
Mr. Liang,

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:19.460
thank you.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.080
Get up quickly.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.160
Come on, let's go.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.560
Everyone, back to work.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.280
So it's confirmed then?

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.040
Lok Pak went to the consulate

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.000
to apply for the transit permit.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.700
The departure time

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.580
is tomorrow at 5 AM sharp.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:38.580
Good.

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:41.350
Do you think we should notify the Navy now

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.430
to set up an ambush

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.850
and catch them red-handed?

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:46.430
No.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.770
I have connections with the Navy.

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:50.590
I'll contact them.

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:52.980
You're a diplomat—

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.560
better to act like you know nothing.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.160
Leave it to me.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:00.210
I understand.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.310
Then I'll leave the rest to you.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.750
Are you ready?

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.310
-All ready.
-Yes.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:09.600
According to the action plan,

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.270
each team, depart separately.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:12.400
At 10 o'clock sharp,

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:14.870
we'll act on time.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:15.960
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.000
Xian, I know you're angry right now,

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.690
but acting impulsively
won't solve anything.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:24.250
When facing the bandit-like Japanese,

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.290
the Portuguese Macau government's
weakness and timidity

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.440
are nothing new.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.230
It's in their nature.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.910
We're frustrated
by their lack of resistance,

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.180
but we can't just let our anger

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.120
make us break ties

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.040
or turn against them.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.930
That would only make the situation worse.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:36.730
Dr. Ke,

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:39.460
things have already come to this point.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.990
What situation
do you still want to maintain?

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:45.510
Because...

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:48.330
our biggest enemy

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:49.950
is the Japanese.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:53.190
Dr. Ke,

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.080
normally, I can accept

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.230
whatever you say,

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.480
but just this once,

00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.330
I can't swallow it.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.940
Wanqi,

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:09.790
Xian is a man guided by his emotions.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:10.910
He can't control his temper right now.

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:11.730
Don't just stand there.

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:12.310
Talk some sense into him.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.910
Dr. Ke,

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.020
I can't swallow it this time either.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.500
I have only one thing
to say to those Portuguese:

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.960
let's go our separate ways

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.020
and make a clean break from now on.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:31.590
Then, Xian,

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:33.210
regarding the SS Sai On Plan,

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.340
will the government risk continuing?

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.990
I've already withdrawn

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.080
and notified Rodrigues and Lok Pak.

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:41.140
How could they possibly continue?

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:43.880
But did you follow up later?

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:45.900
I've also told you.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.270
I didn't even sign.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:48.370
What can they do?

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.290
Xian.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:13.560
Wanqi.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.890
Whether you can accept this or not,

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:20.070
I still need to say something.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.580
No matter how great the indignation,

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:25.020
it must be met
with even greater restraint.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.850
Because compared to the bigger picture,

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:27.600
our personal feelings

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.530
are too insignificant to mention.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.960
I know both of you are people
who understand priorities,

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.360
can reason,
and put the greater good first.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.100
Think carefully

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.160
about what to do next.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.080
Buddy, have you eaten yet?

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.000
This is for you.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:23.910
No, no, no.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.210
Take it, take it.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.440
Take a break.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:34.010
Let's take a break.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:34.410
[Duty Room]

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:34.940
Okay.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:42.480
[Duty Room]

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.940
Mr. Liang!

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.560
Mr. Liang!

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:12.890
Mr. Liang!

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.920
Water Ghost,

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:15.560
what's going on with you?

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.640
Why are you back again?

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.020
Mr. Liang, this is bad!

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.290
I had just left the clinic

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.480
when I ran into Huang Gongjie

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.370
and saw him heading this way with his men!

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:24.830
So I came back to warn you!

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:25.750
Huang Gongjie?

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:26.970
Where are they now?

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.170
They'll be here any minute!

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:30.520
I'll keep watch here!

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.020
Go quickly and alert the Portuguese police
and the crew on the ship!

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:33.810
Hurry!

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:51.420
[No Entry Without Permission]

00:41:58.770 --> 00:41:59.550
What's that?

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:01.710
Come on! Quickly!

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.270
Try harder!

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:11.270
Let's go.
