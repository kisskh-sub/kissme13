00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.340
I had a bit of a fever and felt dizzy.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.380
Are you still dizzy?

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.200
Not anymore.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.760
I'm just worried

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.240
that I didn't do my best this morning.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.600
You're worrying over nothing.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.100
You could

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.680
ace exams like this in your sleep.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.420
Relax, man.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.800
I did finish the whole paper.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.880
Then what's the big deal?

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.460
It's not that you're in a slump.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.560
You're just hyped up.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.560
Kind of like Xiguang.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.060
Hey, what about me?

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:20.940
Back in high school,

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:21.940
she was

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.980
an above-average student at best.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.720
She only started grinding
a few months before the gaokao.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.120
And she even ran a fever
on the day of the exam.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.340
We all thought she was toast.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.620
But when the results came out,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.980
she scored dozens of points
higher than usual.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.980
We all say it's because she was

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.160
so lightheaded
that she actually nailed it.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.920
I'd almost forgotten
about that little episode.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.160
But that's only because

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.520
I've always had the chops.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.840
But

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.980
for some bizarre reasons,

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:39.880
I just couldn't find my groove.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.100
Then the fever hit,

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.020
and it just flipped a switch

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:43.960
in my brain.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:44.820
For real?

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.120
Cross my heart.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.440
Jiang Rui,

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.040
I didn't know you were
such a silent observer,

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:51.960
keeping track

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.480
of my "glorious achievements"

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.460
so meticulously.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:56.260
Admit it, you're a total fanboy,
aren't you?

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.840
Fanboy, my foot!

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.360
I'm a top-three student,

00:19:59.360 --> 00:19:59.900
for crying out loud.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.200
What's so great about that?

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.480
Someone like me,
who stays under the radar,

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.980
only to skyrocket
once I put in the effort

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.360
and nail a top-tier university,
that's what's truly legendary.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:06.840
Got it?

[The second day of the Gaokao]

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:15.760
Xiguang,

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.660
your special one has finally arrived.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.400
Zhuang Fei!

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.080
Hi, Xu.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:36.900
It's time for you guys to head in.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.040
Let's go then.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.700
I'm here to drop Zhuang Fei off.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.420
What a coincidence.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.580
Not really.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.320
I wasn't actually planning on coming.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.560
Really?

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.200
I'll just...

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:10.620
Where did you guys

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.280
have lunch yesterday?

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.180
Thanks for looking after Zhuang Fei.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.420
Lunch's on me today.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.960
Three-cup chicken,
sweet and sour spare ribs,

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.180
sweet and sour pork with pineapple,

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:24.740
braised eggplant,

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.360
fresh watermelon juice.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.140
Would this be

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.220
a bit too much for four?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.520
It's fine.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.040
How did you know

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.400
I was here?

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.200
I asked Rong.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.020
Since you haven't been back to school,

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.460
I decided

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.580
to come here for you.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.960
Rong said

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.260
you're raising money
for your mom's surgery.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.680
Well...

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.180
Here is all the lucky money

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.580
I've saved up. Take it.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.440
There's no rush to pay me back.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.560
Don't worry.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.460
Your mom will make a full recovery.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.740
Zhuang Xu,

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.280
the math's not adding up.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.080
You gave me five thousand yuan extra.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:15.860
Call it interest.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.940
Eight dishes and a soup.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.700
Why do you have to be such a busybody?

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:56.860
Xiguang,

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.200
how was my little plan?

00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.280
I lured him out for you, didn't I?

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:10.760
Jiang Rui.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.160
Do you remember

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.360
when Zhuang Xu's mom was sick,

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.540
I lent him

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.520
fifty thousand yuan?

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.140
Yeah.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.020
You only had 49,200 available

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.200
in your account,

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.320
so you squeezed 800 out of me

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.420
just to make it a round number.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.380
You really don't understand
how men think.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:30.740
You should've given it to him

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:31.960
in small doses.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.660
It would've been more touching.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.660
Later, he paid me back 55,000.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.140
In such a short amount of time,

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.940
he gave me ten percent interest.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.360
So, his coming here today

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.920
is just his way
of paying me back twofold

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.220
for the meal I treated Zhuang Fei to

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.380
yesterday.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.200
He doesn't want to owe me anything.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.220
Don't you see?

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:56.980
But he...

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.800
Didn't he just send you

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.800
those materials for your thesis?

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:00.620
You didn't mention it was him,

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.620
but considering who's capable of that,

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.660
I knew it had to be him.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.400
That's why I...

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.120
The name Zhuang Fei

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.340
was hesitating to mention,

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.720
the person hosting that dinner,

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.540
is my roommate,

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.200
also Zhuang Xu's childhood friend.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:13.940
She...

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.120
did some things

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.120
that weren't very kind to me.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.980
Zhuang Xu helped me with my paper

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.940
just to apologize on her behalf.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.140
What the heck?

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.140
This is infuriating.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.400
You didn't use them, did you?

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.220
Please tell me you didn't use any of it.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.460
Of course I didn't.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.380
Good.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.060
Now that my exams are over,

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.960
I'll help you organize the materials.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.280
I've got the brains, too.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.380
Thanks, genius.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.560
But I've already finalized my thesis.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.160
I'm defending it in a few days.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.440
As long as you didn't use his stuff.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.940
So what if he's going the other way?

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.440
We'll find someone better.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.020
Someone who's going your way.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:58.900
You're my cousin, after all.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.860
You're so considerate.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.320
But Xiguang,

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.120
even for siblings, business is business.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.780
You borrowed 800 from me.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.240
Plus 10% interest,
you owe me 880, right?

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.280
Where's

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.240
this extra 80?

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:21.740
Jiang Rui,

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.000
technically, we're just cousins.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.280
Keep it together.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:44.740
Keep it together.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.300
Stay cool.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:47.740
Stay cool.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.060
Xigua, how are you staying

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.360
so unbothered?

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.020
Ever since my supervisor grilled me,

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.520
I've been on a total grind.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.020
I've basically become a guru

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.700
on my thesis topic.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:06.780
Does a guru ever sweat the small stuff?

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.160
More like a guru of bragging.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.820
Xigua really lucked out

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.180
to have drawn
one of the very last slots.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.020
The rest of us are stuck at the front.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.420
Fen and others are in a different group.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.340
I wonder

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.340
how the draw went for them.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.940
I'll stick around
to keep you company after mine.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.960
No, don't.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.280
Having someone I know there
will only psych me out.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.280
Xie Xiaofeng, Accounting Department.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:29.920
Here.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.040
Nie Xiguang, Accounting Department.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.300
Distinguished professors,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.760
fellow students, good afternoon.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.020
My name is Nie Xiguang,

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.500
from the 2008 intake,

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.140
Class 1, Accounting Department,
Business School.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.060
The title of my thesis

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.020
is Analysis of Oligopolies

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.280
in the Digital Economy.

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.300
I will now present a brief overview

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.900
of my research findings

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.600
from four key aspects.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:19.840
First,

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.560
the background
and significance of the topic.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.020
Over the past two decades,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.120
the world has entered

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.260
the age of the Internet.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.580
China's network economy

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.420
has also begun to take off.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.280
Gradually, oligopolies

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.260
have emerged

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.640
within various market segments.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.660
That concludes

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.240
my presentation.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.000
I look forward to your feedback.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.020
I just finished my defense.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.840
I was one of the last ones to go.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.020
Mom, don't worry.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.720
I totally nailed it.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:06.660
See? When it counts,

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:07.840
I actually have my act together,

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.400
okay?

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.940
I'm gonna pack up some stuff

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.900
and head over to my uncle's.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.600
Anyway, I should get going.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.240
Bye.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.000
Xiguang,

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.160
let me

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:19.800
treat you to dinner.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.600
That's really not necessary.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.340
I insist.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:30.960
Then...

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.720
let's invite Feng and the others.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.280
Just the two of us.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.400
I'm absolutely spent.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.020
How did she get this wasted?

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.160
Nie Xiguang,

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.520
do you think

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.720
I'm some two-faced fake?

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.000
Like I'm just a petty gossip?

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.600
You've had too much.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.660
Fine. Let's just blame it on the bear.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.240
You have no idea

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.700
everyone's always talking about you.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.140
You're not even from around here,

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.160
yet you live off-campus.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.320
Word started getting around

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.680
from your high school classmates

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.280
about your family.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:22.540
And when

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:24.560
Zhuang Xu's mom got sick,

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:26.920
you just

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.080
dropped all that cash.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.020
That's when it finally hit me

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:31.960
how different

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.180
our worlds really are.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.660
Siliang, she's the type

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.560
who wants to have it all together.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.980
She tries to put on

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.440
a perfect front for everyone.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.820
But the second a crack shows,

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.780
she just falls apart.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.580
I had no idea
you saw through her like that.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.140
Just a wild guess.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.140
Xigua,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.780
I got my ticket this afternoon.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.860
What's the rush?

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.720
My parents are really pushing me.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.040
There's a lot of paperwork to do

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.220
once I get back to Xiamen.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.739
But I'm not leaving just yet.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.040
I've still got a few days.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.520
Don't look so down.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.260
We'll definitely see each other again.

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:23.679
Xiamen isn't that far anyway.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:25.540
Oh, that reminds me

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:26.800
I still owe

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.020
everyone a meal.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.540
I'd love one last meal

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.199
at Hesheng before I head out.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.500
Sure,

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.460
I've been craving that too.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.360
Then after your treat,

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.800
I'll take everyone out

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.880
for boiled fish
with pickled mustard greens.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:49.780
Xigua.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.659
Zhuo Hui, Zhuang Xu, and the others

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:54.080
treated me...

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.440
and Rong.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.220
It's okay.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.200
Don't overthink it.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.500
Whatever happened in the past

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.920
didn't have anything to do with you.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:07.860
Besides,

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.200
I've decided to let it go.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.820
I'm Zhang Zhen, from Shandong.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:21.560
How about you guys?

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.880
Xie Xiaofeng, from Nantong.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.360
I'm Ye Rong. I'm a local.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.300
Zhou Yufen, from Fujian.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.660
Just call me Fen.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.280
Then you can just call me Siliang.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.460
My last name is Fei.
[*Homophonic pun on the full name,]

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:35.840

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.900
I'm Nie Xiguang,

from Wuxi.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.120
Xigua,

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:00.540
we've only got a few days left.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.560
Come back and stay in the dorms with us.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.860
We're actually graduating.

The packing just never ends, does it?

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.980
Why do you have to go so far away?

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.320
I wonder if we'll even

see each other much after this.

that they were seeing you off
at the station.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.480
And we thought, since who knows

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.660
when we'll all see each other again,

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.200
