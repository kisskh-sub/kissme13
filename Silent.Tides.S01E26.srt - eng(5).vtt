[Silent Tides]

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.979
[Episode 26]

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.210
Regarding the detailed confession,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.610
the Zhongshan authorities are currently
conducting further interrogation.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.590
The three cooperating parties are

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.890
the Tai Ho Brotherhood,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.600
the Chinese Communist guerrillas,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.460
and various Portuguese
and Chinese merchants

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.759
led by Rodrigues and Ma Wanqi.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.560
The mastermind:

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.620
Chairman of Macau Banking Association

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.919
and General Manager
of Tai Fung Bank, He Xian.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.040
Well? Mr. Fukue.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.210
I was right, wasn't I?

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.020
Report!

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:23.630
Chief,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.920
there's an emergency.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.610
Blood pressure:

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.690
40/70.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.480
Flashlight.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.240
Director Ke,

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.329
what should we do?

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.100
Fortunately, Mr. Ma arrived just in time.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.070
Otherwise, the consequences
would have been unimaginable.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.690
It was because Yang Chang
received Commander Ou's telegram

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.890
and learned that you were bringing
Captain Long to Macau

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.130
that he notified us to send people
to meet and assist you.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.930
That's right.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.490
We didn't know when you would arrive,

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.210
so several vehicles kept circling

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.890
along the Gongbei blockade line,
searching over and over.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.690
Fortunately,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.079
I managed to find you.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.420
Thank you.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.050
Lin,

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.020
how is Captain Long?

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.410
Her condition is critical.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.070
She needs immediate surgery.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.040
So...

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.800
Should we transfer her to
the Conde S. Januário Hospital?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.730
There's no time.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.670
I have no choice but to use
the Kiang Wu operating room.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.300
I'll perform the surgery myself
right away.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.470
You keep watch outside,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.780
and if anything unexpected happens,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.010
do whatever you can to buy us some time.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.740
Understood.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.170
Do you know who that female Communist
you've been pursuing is?

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.430
I only know she's the liaison
between Ou Xin's guerrilla unit

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.960
and the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.640
According to the testimony of Liang Zhong
from the Tai Ho Brotherhood,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.430
this person is Long Haishan,

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.830
captain of the White Dove Unit

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.270
of the Zhongshan Guerrilla Forces,

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.450
who's also the intelligence officer of
the Chinese Communist base in Black Hill.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.360
She

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.750
not only holds

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.900
all the secrets of
the underground supply line operations,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.650
but also

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.000
possesses information about the entire
Communist underground intelligence network

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.810
across
the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau region.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.510
Seems like she really is a big fish.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.779
No wonder the Communists

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.110
desperately wanted to bring her to Macau.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.940
In Macau,

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.260
only the CHCSJ has
the facilities for surgery.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.650
Yamaguchi,

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.680
take your team there immediately.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.970
Make sure to capture her alive.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.500
Yes, Sir.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.290
Captain Huang,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.260
take your men to Tai Fung Bank

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.340
and arrest He Xian.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.250
Yes, Sir.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.540
Mr. Fukue,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.340
it's about time we go to
the Portuguese Macau government

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.110
to hear what Governor De Solaire

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.390
has to say.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.270
Hello, this is Qiao Yinwan.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.860
It's me.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.050
Listen to me.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.210
I just called Tai Fung Bank.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.670
They said He Xian went to
Kiang Wu Hospital.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.430
I'm worried

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.620
the hospital's phone lines
might be tapped.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.960
Hurry over there—

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.370
the Japanese are going to arrest him.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.860
What?

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.710
Why would the Japanese want to arrest him?

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.700
There's no time to explain.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.950
He knows everything about this.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.190
Just tell him

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.920
the Steamship Sai On incident
has been exposed

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.340
and Liang Zhong from Tai Ho Brotherhood
has confessed everything.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.250
The Japanese are working with the police
to arrest him.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.980
Tell him to escape immediately

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.540
before it's too late.

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.040
Xian!

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.120
The Japanese are coming to arrest you.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.920
You need to go.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.980
Xian,

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.880
hurry up and leave.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.480
That's right, you should go.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.360
No need.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.460
Since I signed the ship rental guarantee,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.060
I've already been prepared.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.830
Right now, our biggest concern

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.160
should be Captain Long.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.850
Dr. Ke mentioned that

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.920
this surgery

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.650
would take at least 4 hours.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.180
The CHCSJ just called, saying

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.730
the Japanese didn't find
what they want there

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.530
and will soon arrive at Kiang Wu.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.360
Therefore,

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.130
we must do everything

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.160
we can to buy Dr. Ke

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.810
more time.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.460
Open up! Official business!

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.550
Open the gate now!

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.960
I'll go stall them.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.740
-Anyone in there? Open the gate!
-Xian, staying here won't do any good.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.590
Leave quickly through the back door.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.120
Be quick.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.890
Go now!

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.680
Right, take the back door.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.060
Just go.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.220
Xian?

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.710
Open the gate! Hurry up.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.990
Open the gate now!

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.740
I'm Ma Wanqi from
the Kiang Wu Charitable Association.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.560
What's your business here

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.020
in the middle of the night?

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.230
Mr. Ma,

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.030
listen to me.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.480
Here's the thing.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.620
He Xian, General Manager of Tai Fung Bank,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.430
is now suspected of being involved in
a case of smuggling supplies.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.120
The police

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.310
are here to arrest him
and take him in for investigation.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.240
According to intelligence from
our Japanese enforcement partners,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.190
He Xian has come to Kiang Wu Hospital.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.840
Please open the gate.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.850
We need to go in and find him now.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.930
I'm sorry,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.030
but I haven't seen him in the hospital.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.600
If you want to find He Xian,

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.030
go where you should go.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.710
I've received intelligence

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.710
that He Xian

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.590
is right here in Kiang Wu Hospital.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.930
If you don't open the gate right now,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.550
you'll be

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.290
obstructing Japanese-Portuguese
joint law enforcement.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.730
Fine.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.140
If you want to search the hospital,

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.420
show me the proper search warrant.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.640
Colonel Sawa,

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.590
this matter is too rushed.

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:50.850
We indeed didn't get a search warrant
before coming here.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.270
Maybe we should wait until it's confirmed

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.210
that He Xian is indeed in the hospital,

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.700
then go back, obtain a search warrant,
and come back.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.930
Stop making excuses to stall!

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.860
Anyone who dares to obstruct the search

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.910
will be treated as an accomplice
and convicted accordingly.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.390
Ma Wanqi,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.890
are you going

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.440
to open this gate or not?

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.150
Colonel Sawa,

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.520
calm down. Please calm down.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.559
Colonel Sawa.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.409
Macau abides by the law.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.480
What do you think you're doing?

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.789
Put that gun down now.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.430
Xian,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:51.550
bad news.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.780
Huang Gongjie

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.340
has brought a large group of
intelligence agents

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.530
and surrounded the hospital's
back door.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.500
What do we do now?

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.710
They've blocked both doors.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.510
Xian, how about

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.530
you hide somewhere
in the hospital for now?

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:01.860
No.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:02.910
Fei,

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:03.990
give me the car key.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.600
What do you want to do?

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.150
Aren't they here for me?

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.670
I'll drive out and draw them away

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.140
to buy Dr. Ke more time for the surgery.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.350
I'll come with you.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.960
No, it's too dangerous.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.960
You should know
their target isn't just you,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.080
but also Captain Long.

Inspector General Gonçalves,

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.250
why aren't you taking your men after them?

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:15.580

My Sawa Agency's Special Operations Team

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.870
saw him driving away

through the back door with their own eyes.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.650
How could I be mistaken?

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.260
Inspector General Gonçalves,

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.910
if you deliberately delay any further,
it'll be considered willful harboring.

If He Xian manages to escape
because of this,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.460
I'd like to see how
your Macau Police Department

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.280
I'm okay.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.050
Mr. He. On behalf of the Macau police,

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.600
I will be questioning you

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.550
regarding the Steamship Sai On
smuggling case.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.080
Please answer truthfully.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:26.020
No problem.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.260
Good.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.180
Is this the ship rental guarantee document

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.790
that you personally signed
for Steamship Sai On?

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:33.490
Yes.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.700
Steamship Sai On

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.760
was indeed rented with my guarantee.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:37.790
Then,

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.200
is the massive amount of
undeclared diesel on the ship

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.030
also yours?

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.310
It was,

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.530
but not anymore.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.720
What do you mean? Please explain clearly.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:47.900
This batch of diesel

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.560
was originally imported legally
by Rodrigues.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.620
Since they owed Tai Fung Bank money,

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.680
they gave it to me as payment in kind.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.500
So it was mine originally.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.020
Then why isn't it yours anymore?

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.730
And if it was legally imported,

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:00.830
why wasn't it declared to the government

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.880
during the inspection?

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.350
Because just before
the declaration period ended,

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.910
I had already sold it to another client.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.700
Since the diesel has changed hands,

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.420
it was naturally up to the new client
to declare it on time.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.950
And my client said he would declare it
on time—

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.130
I had no reason to doubt him, right?

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.540
If you had sold it to someone else,

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.380
then why did you still

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.620
arrange to rent a ship
to transport the diesel?

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.450
Because under
the Portuguese-Japanese joint regulations

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.510
issued during the major inspection,

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.400
renting a government vessel
required a representative

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.400
from Macau's business community
to act as guarantor.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.770
My client didn't have such qualifications,

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:33.960
so I stepped in

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.080
to handle the ship rental procedures

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.760
on behalf of my client.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.500
So you're saying
the diesel belongs to someone else,

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.370
you didn't know it wasn't declared,

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.770
and you only guaranteed the ship rental
for your client?

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.420
Is that right?

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:44.900
Yes.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:45.770
Then,

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.110
who is your client,

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.390
the real owner of the cargo?

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.040
I'm sorry.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.150
I signed a confidentiality agreement
with my client.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:54.160
I cannot say.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:56.510
Mr. He, all evidence now points to you.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:58.150
If you don't reveal the real owner,

00:23:58.150 --> 00:23:59.480
you might end up

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.710
taking the blame for smuggling yourself.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:02.820
As a businessman,

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.710
I must maintain my integrity.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.300
I cannot tell you.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:13.850
Keep it steady.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.780
Come on, slowly.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.310
Here.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.770
Slowly.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.890
Careful.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:23.540
Up there. Up there.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.630
Steady now. Steady now.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.610
Come on.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.660
One, two...

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:28.830
Go.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.780
Be careful.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.170
Alright.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:42.920
Mr. He,

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.950
since you refuse to disclose
your client's information to the police,

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.930
according to the Portuguese-Japanese
Joint Anti-Smuggling Agreement,

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.670
the Japanese representative,
Colonel Sawa Eisaku,

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.280
will conduct a private questioning
with you.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.340
Please cooperate.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.000
Mr. He.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.470
Back in Hong Kong,

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.270
you were nothing but

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.260
an obscure small bank merchant.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.530
When you fled to Macau,

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:13.870
you were even

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.400
completely broke,

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.290
no different from
those tens of thousands of

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.340
starving, destitute refugees.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.140
But in just two and a half years,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.370
you've risen to become

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.470
the General Manager of
Macau's largest Chinese merchants' bank,

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:34.230
the first Chinese business manager at BNU,

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.610
and even secured

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.950
the chairman position of
the Macau Banking Association.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.270
And all this

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.470
took merely two and a half years.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.420
Remarkable indeed.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.350
To be honest,

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.470
I, Sawa Eisaku,

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.820
truly admire you, Mr. He,

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.330
from the bottom of my heart.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.470
But precisely because of that,

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.640
I find it

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.160
all the more regrettable for you.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.340
Regrettable in what way?

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.810
It's regrettable that you, Mr. He,

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.180
show no regard for

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.180
everything you've worked so hard
to achieve.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.290
You don't even care about

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.010
the home you've gone to such lengths

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.490
to finally settle down in.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.270
Instead, you chose to take the blame
for someone else,

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:37.380
putting yourself

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.150
in an irredeemable situation.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.250
Is it that serious?

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:47.250
Liang Zhong, the master of Haiyun Hall
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood—

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:48.480
Mr. He,

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.620
you should know him well.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.040
After Liang Zhong was arrested,

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.480
he confessed everything in Zhongshan,

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.940
including all the secrets behind

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.900
Macau's trade in strategic materials,

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:04.560
as well as

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.330
the organizers behind it all.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:09.300
Mr. He,

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.020
you should know

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.530
what that means.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.780
According to Liang Zhong,

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.560
the owner of the diesel

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.390
involved in this smuggling case

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.710
wasn't you.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:25.260
You even

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.700
wasn't willing to transport it at first.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.680
The entire smuggling plan
using Steamship Sai On

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.110
was actually

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:35.090
orchestrated by
the Portuguese Macau government

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.140
and Rodrigues. Isn't that right?

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:43.830
I'm sorry.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.200
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.730
You understand perfectly,

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.270
Mr. He.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.510
Setting aside

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:57.530
the past two and a half years,

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.160
let's just talk about

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.530
this case of Steamship Sai On
caught in the act.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.560
It was entirely
the Portuguese Macau government's doing.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.800
They directly planned

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.750
and organized

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.950
the transport of massive war supplies

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.470
to aid the British-American Allied Forces
and the Chinese government.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.250
This

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:21.800
was a blatant act of war.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.120
And yet, after it happened,

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:28.580
you became

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.830
the guarantor for the ship rental,

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.490
which made you
the scapegoat of this crime.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.690
Mr. He,

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.560
I wonder

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.910
what benefits
the Portuguese Macau government

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.390
promised you

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:48.970
that made you

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.360
willingly take on this role?

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.900
Did they promise you a clean acquittal,

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.530
or did they promise that
the government would back you—

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.540
letting you off
with only a light punishment

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.990
in exchange for

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.680
greater benefits down the line?

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.720
But in short,

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.180
you've been deceived.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.700
Not to mention
for the past two and a half years,

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.190
you've been the backbone

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.240
of Macau's anti-Japanese
underground supply line,

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.590
just this smuggling case
with Steamship Sai On alone

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:22.950
is already backed by

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:24.900
ironclad evidence.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.850
And once the verdict is reached,

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:31.970
we Japanese have the right to demand
extradition of the principal offender.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.200
When that happens, let alone
the Portuguese Macau government—

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.880
even if Lisbon steps in,

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.770
they won't be able to protect you,

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.140
Mr. He Xian.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.830
Colonel Sawa, since you keep saying

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:52.530
there are both witnesses
and physical evidence,

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:55.240
then why waste your breath
talking to me here?

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.970
I just...

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.740
Feel sorry to lose someone
of your caliber.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.900
I wanted to give you a way out.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.540
Is that so?

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:09.610
Haven't you been dreaming of
destroying me, Colonel Sawa?

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.410
Now that the chance has arrived,

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.530
why are you suddenly being so polite?

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:15.580
Let me

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.230
guess the reason.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.310
That captured suspect from Zhongshan
you mentioned

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:22.010
only has hearsay evidence

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.050
and has never directly dealt with
the Macau government.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.350
You can't possibly convict
the Macau government

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.650
based on just a secondhand testimony.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:30.970
That's why

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.180
you wanted to use me,
someone directly involved,

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.720
to falsely accuse the Macau government,

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.210
so as to charge the Macau government

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:39.960
with violating neutrality

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.660
and participating in the war.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:43.290
Isn't that right?

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:48.470
Whatever the case,

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.540
if you refuse to cooperate,

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.310
you'll die a horrible death.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:59.420
You know perfectly well

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.860
how the Portuguese Macau government

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:04.020
has been treating you Chinese people.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.290
I just don't understand

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.150
why you feel the need

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.680
to be their scapegoat.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:12.750
To protect them,

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.270
you're even willing to risk your own life

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.610
and your entire family's future.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.880
Alright, that's all I'll say.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.850
When talking to a smart person,

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.700
a hint is enough.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:32.110
There're two paths before you right now.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.250
One is to confess the truth,

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.160
and our Empire of Japan

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.250
will guarantee you a secure position

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.930
at the very top of
Macau's business community.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.010
And the second

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.920
is to remain obstinate—

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.310
as for how that path ends,

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.390
you know very well yourself.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.160
What's with that laugh?

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.470
I was laughing because Colonel Sawa,

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.340
you really are quite the schemer.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.640
Forcing me to falsely accuse
the Macau government

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.280
to give you a good excuse

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.850
for your armed occupation of Macau.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.050
And once I betray the Macau government,

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.490
I'll have no way back.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.390
I can only willingly become a traitor

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.080
to serve you Japanese

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.490
and provide you with endless supplies.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.560
My life

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.070
in exchange for the entire Macau

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.330
and the countless supplies you dream of—

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:30.440
what a profitable deal indeed.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.050
If you don't cooperate,

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:37.490
you're finished.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:42.230
Your underground supply network
will be finished as well.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.290
You're doomed either way.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.280
The only difference is

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.540
whether you want to save yourself

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.860
or those Portuguese.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.420
It's clearly a losing deal,

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.580
so why would you

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.270
go down with those Portuguese

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.300
who can offer you nothing in return?

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.110
In your view,

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:12.420
anyone who does anything

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.080
only does it to gain

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.290
greater benefits for themselves.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:17.290
Isn't that right?

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.390
What else

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.980
could it possibly be for?

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.440
That's why

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.640
you'll never understand.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.540
Because bandits are always
blinded by greed,

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.630
and people like you

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.090
know nothing but threats and bribes.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.920
Alright.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.060
I've said all I have to say.

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:42.850
If you think I'll falsely accuse
the Macau government,

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.600
you've miscalculated.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.670
When there's a road to Heaven,
you refuse to take it;

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.900
and when there's no gate to hell,
you walk right in.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:54.670
He Xian,

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:55.900
then

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:59.010
don't blame me for what happens next.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.060
Yamaguchi.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:07.470
Yes, Sir.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.679
Notify Lin Nianci in Zhongshan County

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:11.820
to immediately bring
the prisoner Liang Zhong

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.760
and his detailed confession

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:15.420
to Macau.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:16.620
Yes, Sir.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.520
Dr. Ke,

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.210
how is Captain Long?

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.420
She's out of danger now.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.500
She should be able to pull through.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.760
What about Zhengping?

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:43.030
He's in the ward.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.980
He'll probably need one or two months
to recover.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:47.929
Any news on your end?

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:50.110
Lok Pak called an hour ago.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.260
Sawa Eisaku has ordered Zhongshan

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.460
to transfer Mr. Liang and his confession
to Macau.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.620
Yang Chang has urgently notified
Commander Ou.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.080
He said he'll do everything he can
to stop it,

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.860
but there's no guarantee

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:02.150
he'll succeed.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.890
What about Xian? Where is he?

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.640
He was taken by
the Portuguese authorities.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.080
I understand.

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.670
It seems that this time,

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.270
whether Xian and Macau
can get through this crisis

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:22.730
is up to Commander Ou.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.710
What should we do with this little one,
Magistrate Lin?

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.110
Take him along.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:41.530
When we get to Macau,
if you recant your confession

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.690
or say anything you shouldn't,

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.210
as for your precious grandson,

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.410
I'll immediately...

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.390
Rest assured.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:49.490
Rest assured.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.180
I won't say anything.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.320
Not a word.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.230
Let's go.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.340
Chief, we received a telegram
from Zhongshan.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.900
Mr. He.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.260
I have news for you.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.520
Lin Nianci,
Magistrate of Zhongshan County,

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.650
has already departed with the prisoner.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.630
It's now 6:30.

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:30.420
By 7:00 at the latest,

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.480
they will rendezvous with
the Imperial Army's escort ship.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.690
I have to warn you.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.460
Once the suspect
is handed over to the navy,

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.740
it'll be out of my control.

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:43.990
So,

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.740
you have at most

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.150
half an hour left.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.750
It's your last chance to tell

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.740
the truth about Steamship Sai On.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.050
Alright.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.750
I'll say it.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.820
Good.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:13.110
You're finally willing to talk.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.330
Go ahead and tell me.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:17.070
It's not too late yet.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.650
But we're in Macau now,

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.250
and I rented Steamship Sai On
from the Macau government.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:21.930
Therefore,

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.280
I'll only confess to the Macau police.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.380
Inspector General Gonçalves.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.940
Mr. He.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.320
Please have all irrelevant personnel leave

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.620
and turn off the surveillance.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:35.850
I'll tell only you.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.360
Colonel Sawa.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:39.890
No.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.920
This is a Japanese-Portuguese
joint investigation.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.110
I must know the suspect's statement.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:48.730
But this is still Macau,

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.300
and even in a joint investigation,

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.890
the Macau police have priority.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:55.800
Colonel Sawa,
if you don't want to solve this case,

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.860
then by all means, keep wasting time.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.890
Wait.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.440
Fine.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.400
At this point,

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.630
I doubt you can pull any tricks anyway.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:20.810
I'll leave.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.030
Governor,

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.480
He Xian has just confessed

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.340
who the real owner of
the smuggled diesel is.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.000
Who is it?

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:53.920
I'm sorry, but the suspect's confession
may not be accurate.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.810
The police need to further investigate
and gather evidence,

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.580
and after confirming the authenticity
of the confession,

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.870
we will inform you of the results.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:01.010
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.670
I request permission to lead a team

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.380
to arrest the smuggling suspect
named by He Xian

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.070
to verify the truth.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:06.910
You have my permission.
Take action immediately.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:07.440
Yes, Sir.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:22.990
Boss!

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.320
What's wrong? Don't panic.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.980
Take your time. What happened?

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.860
Bad news!

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.730
Something bad happened!

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:29.660
What happened?

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:33.070
I just called Tai Fung Bank
and the He family to follow up,

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.360
only to learn that
He Xian was arrested last night.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.530
Arrested?

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:38.460
What's going on?

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.730
He was arrested by the Macau police
and Agency Chief Sawa together.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:42.490
I heard

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:44.880
it was because of
the Steamship Sai On's...

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.600
Something like a diesel smuggling case.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.870
Steamship Sai On?

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.490
But I've checked the diesel.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:49.670
[No smoking or fire in the warehouse]

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:50.550
