[Entertainment Building]

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.450
Did you bring the coins?

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.690
Where are the goods?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.910
Thirty gold coins.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.329
I need to see them first.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.410
I need to check the goods first.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.100
Fine.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.410
Look, inside it are

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.470
the souls of 3 people.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.710
They're all

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.820
from the elders over 70.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.110
You can calculate it.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.710
If you swallow all the souls

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.030
in the bottle in one go,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.620
how many years of life would that extend?

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.630
How am I supposed to trust you?

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.190
What if

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.710
you actually took

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.840
3 young men's souls?

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.490
That's impossible.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:17.560
I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.470
put strychnine in their food

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.650
and drink myself.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.800
And I

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.290
extracted their souls myself.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.690
I see.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.910
You must admit this treasure is

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.420
worth 30 gold coins.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.780
It's fine if you don't want it.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.360
The Ghost Market is crawling
with people after it.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.630
In that case,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.360
your price

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.490
seems fair enough.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.520
Right?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.590
It hurts!

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.840
Ouch!

Zuo Lu.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.590
As a sorcery tutor
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine,

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.800
you specifically targeted elderly people

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.470
to extract the so-called souls

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.520
and sell them at high prices

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.120
to wealthy people on their deathbeds
to extend their lives.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.850
You're guilty of a major crime!

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.750
It hurts!

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.160
It really hurts...

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.990
And you!

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.040
You're the buyer, aren't you?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.300
You also need to come
to the county office for questioning.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.800
This is Chang'an County territory.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.400
I am the county sheriff here.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.560
It's not your place to make arrests.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.490
Look carefully.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.409

I've been watching for 2 days and nights.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.280
Perhaps they have been watching
even longer.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.510
Tell me

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.240
why you only used strychnine
to poison them!

in excruciating agony.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.920
Only this way

can the soul be squeezed out.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.370
That's unbelievably evil.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.080
For this so-called "squeezing out souls,"

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.520
do you have any evidence?

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.630
I've tried it.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.780
Really!

After a person dies,

the body will become lighter.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.000
It's lighter by a solid half tael!

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.190
Tell me, if this half tael is

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.190
not his soul,

Shut up!

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.150
This is blatant nonsense to fool people!

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.480
You also killed Grand General Zhu Ling
of the Left Imperial Guard,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.600

Well...

His manner of death is

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.310
identical to that of the old men

I heard that Zuo Lu confessed.
Is that true?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.760
Yes.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.090
He's just a sorcery tutor

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.510
who can't fight.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.630
And he was under the strict surveillance

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.190
of the Yongzhou Prefecture.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.600
How could he possibly kill

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.270
the Grand General of the Imperial Guard?

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.770
Of course I know this.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.250
Zuo Lu's confession was

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.690
likely forced by Wei Yan's torture.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.700
As for Wei Yan's motive,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.800
it remains unknown for now.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.720
I've seen

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.050
Zhu Ling's body.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.200
There was a hit to the temple.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.360
We can't determine the weapon,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.620
but one thing is for sure.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.770
The killer is the same one

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.720
who murdered the beggar before.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.560
Therefore,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.210
Wannian County requested
to merge the cases.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.370
Without other evidence for now,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.450
I'm afraid Wei Yan won't agree.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.720
Before it's reported

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.070
to the Yongzhou Prefecture,

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.600
I cannot intervene either.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.510
I have a feeling

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.000
that if the real murderer
remains at large,

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.830
more people will die.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.310
How much

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.130
do you want for these items?

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.070
Whatever you think is fair, sir.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.070
We're not greedy.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.920
Then how about

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.520
5,000 coins?

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.740
5,000 coins?

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.480
Okay! Nice!

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:52.580
Good!

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.130
That's the price then.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.680
Wait.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.880
I think these items are

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.640
worth at least 50,000 coins.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.270
Why don't you

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.760
sell them to me instead?

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.250
Hey, you!

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.430
How can you mess with my business
in my shop?

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.710
They don't even know

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.160
whether their items are

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.150
worth 5,000

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.920
or 50,000 coins themselves.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.800
They're apparently thieves,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.530
aren't they?

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.430
If you take these items,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.000
you're helping them sell stolen goods.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.190
Take these stolen goods

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.250
to the Wannian County Office with me!

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.310
[Wannian County Office]

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.240
Gulou Pastry?

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.260
Yes.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.600
The old man said

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.840
that's the name of the food in the box.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.900
How much did he eat?

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:35.760
Half a piece.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.210
Then he eagerly

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.570
pulled me into the room.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.080
That old lecher.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.450
When we saw he was dying,

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.000
my wife and I were terrified.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.120
We only wanted money,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.050
never anyone's life.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.160
So we ran away in a rush.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.450
But as the saying goes,

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.730
"A thief never leaves empty-handed."

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.010
So we grabbed those few items.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.460
And you said that Gulou Pastry was

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.110
given to him by someone else?

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:02.950
Yes.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.450
The day before that, I saw that old man

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.240
spending lavishly in Pingkang District,

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.670
so I deliberately wandered back and forth
in front of him.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.510
Then

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:11.670
we made an appointment to meet

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.330
at his residence the next day.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.150
Did you get a good look at that person?

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.950
It was a bit far away.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.920
I only saw a blurry outline.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.040
Yingtao.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.700
Go fetch Xijun.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.390
Yes.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.590
First seduction, then blackmail.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.170
That's a serious crime.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.500
Now, you need

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.550
to carefully recall the appearance

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.670
of the person who offered the gift

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.120
and help the county office draw a sketch.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.510
This may earn you leniency.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.400
Understand?

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.570
Yes.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.630
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.320
Honey,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.070
it all counts on you now.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.200
The female culprit doesn't remember

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.510
the gift-giver's face clearly.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.340
She did say it was quite far away.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.060
Strangely enough,

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.440
though it was far away,

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.790
she can remember the person's eyes.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.720
She just has no impression
of the facial expression.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.970
Why does he look so much like someone?

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.480
The one we met in Hanzhou Prefecture.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.840
He's called Ma...

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.790
Ma Meng, Official Ma.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.570
When I was drawing,

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.900
I had the same illusion.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.670
Maybe it's because I recently ate

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.670
the Gulou Pastries he treated me to.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.380
I'm afraid it's not an illusion.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.260
you have visitors.

[Holy Mt. Yao with Radiant Jade]

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:09.960
It must be

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.600
my old classmate, Liu Zigui.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.330
Let him in.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.320
It's not Mr. Liu,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.330
but Lu Lingfeng,
the Yongzhou Judicial Officer,

[Holy Mt. Yao with Radiant Jade]

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.000
and Su Wuming,
the Wannian County Assistant Magistrate.

It's them?

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.550
Hurry. Invite them in.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.960
Yes.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.440
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.390
I apologize for not greeting you properly.

Official Lu.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.870
Since we parted in Hanzhou Prefecture,

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.670
we finally met again in Chang'an.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.600
Secretariat Ma,

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.750
I was occupied with official duties before

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.240
and had to break our appointment.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.270
Please forgive me.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:40.900
It's okay.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.070
That day,

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.070
Mr. Su and I had a wonderful chat.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.580
Indeed.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.670
Especially after tasting
the Scholar Tree Leaf Cold Noodles,

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:47.890
that unique flavor

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
kept me feeling refreshed for days!

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.680
If you put it that way,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.600
then we should thank you

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.870
for specifically sending us

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.620

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.080
Since that day,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.600
I've been frequenting Yiwei Eatery

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.330
just for those Gulou Pastries.

[Quick Guide to Zuo's Commentary on Spring
and Autumn Annals, by Du Yuankai]

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.810
Mr. Ma, you're reading
the "Spring and Autumn Annals"?

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.200
This version
of "Spring and Autumn Annals" is

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.600
quite rare to find

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.490
in bookstores.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.700
[Quick Guide to Zuo's Commentary on Spring
and Autumn Annals, by Du Yuankai]

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.000
It's the "Spring and Autumn Annals"
annotated by Du Yuankai,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.430
truly a rare find.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.720
I wonder

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.240
where you obtained it, Mr. Ma.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.460
It's all thanks

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.010
to my classmate, Liu Zigui.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.550
He has a deep understanding
of the "Spring and Autumn Annals."

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.390
Though he hasn't passed
the imperial exams,

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.080
he often gives lessons at Ximing Temple

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.240
and Zhao Jinggong Temple,

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.550
teaching the "Spring and Autumn Annals"

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.390
to the students
who lodge in the temples, preparing

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.750
for the Exam of Classical Studies.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.210
He's quite popular there.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.570
Then he must come from a scholarly family.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.720
I wonder which Confucian Master

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.260
his ancestor was?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.930
Honestly, I don't know about that.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.930
He's also never mentioned it.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.960
He's not only knowledgeable
about the classics

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.840
but also well-versed in painting.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.790
Every time he visits,

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.080
he stares at that screen

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.110
for half an hour.

Strangely enough,

this screen

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.880
bears no artist's signature,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.720
yet the Palace Secretariat
treasures it so much.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.310
It's said

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.600
that when His Majesty
visited the Palace Secretariat,

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.400
he also stood before this screen
for quite a while.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.920
This isn't a real polo field.

It's way too small, anyway.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.080
Mr. Lu, you're a polo master

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.080
of our Tang Empire.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.540
You noticed it right away.

with the aura of an emperor,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.940
must be Crown Prince Hong, right?

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.750
You're so sharp-eyed, Mr. Su.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.030
That is indeed Emperor Xiaojing.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.500
Actually,

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.670
I have seen

Emperor Xiaojing's portrait before.

I've been
thinking about Crown Prince Hong.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.500
If he hadn't died so young,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.640
the Tang Empire today

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.920
would be completely different.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.950
You know what?

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.850
Before His Majesty decided to compete

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.840
in the international polo tournament
in person,

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.440
he took me to pay respects
to Emperor Xiaojing.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.160
Why did His Majesty do that?

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.750
First of all,

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.030
Emperor Xiaojing was the best polo player

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.410
in the imperial family.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.650
It was also his idea back then

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.840
to hold a polo tournament every 4 years

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.240
to pacify foreign territories

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.320
and reinforce diplomatic ties.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.920
That's how

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.050
the international polo tournament
came into being.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440
And then...

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.440
I know what happened afterward.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.840
Crown Prince Hong died without a son.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:39.970
Years later,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.550
Empress Wu Zetian had
the Prince of Chu at that time

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.750
be his heir.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.870
The Prince of Chu back then

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.150
became today's Emperor.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.720
Where's Yingtao?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.510
She must be busy with something.

You don't suspect Ma Meng, do you?

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.480

risked his life fighting that battle.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.410
I really respect him for that.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.610
Today,

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.000
Ma Meng was talking
in a completely honest way.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.720
Does he look like a murderer?
