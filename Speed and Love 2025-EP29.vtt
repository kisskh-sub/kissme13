[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.740
[Episode 29]

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.930
What are you thinking about?

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.890
Can't sleep?

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.330
Why can't you sleep either?

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.560
On the way here,
didn't you say you were sleepy?

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.040
I can't sleep either.

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.730
I didn't expect you'd prepare all this.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.930
If I don't prepare,

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.450
how can I marry you?

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.010
Tomorrow,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.050
I'll have a good talk with Mom.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.960
It's okay.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.050
At least

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.680
she hasn't kicked me out yet,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.920
which is already good progress.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.610
Why are you in someone else's room

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.209
in the middle of the night
instead of sleeping?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.630
Go back now.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.040
That thing during the day got delayed,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.500
so it wasn't finished.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.320
So I want to get it done

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.810
before going to bed.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.120
Otherwise,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.160
tomorrow would bring more things
to deal with.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.490
Do you still remember how to fix it?

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.500
I think I do.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.850
You do it.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.970
That's just how I am.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.409
When daytime tasks

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.000
aren't done,

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.260
I can't even sleep peacefully.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.590
But Jin Qiang doesn't think this way.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.280
To him, doing it today,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.930
tomorrow,

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.730
or days later

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.440
makes no difference.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.320
I remember

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.820
he had terrible procrastination issues.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.490
Once

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.910
the window screens at home got dirty,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.770
I asked him
to take them down and wash them.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.610
He actually took

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.570
over a week before finally doing it.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.220
Little things like that

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.320
kept us arguing nonstop.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.170
I remember back then,

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.800
in our old place in Nanjing,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.360
I loved growing plants.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.210
The apartment was small

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.930
and already cluttered.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.670
But Jin Qiang

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.800
thought they were pointless

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.420
and wouldn't let me keep them.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.090
He even smashed them.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.090
Jin Qiang, don't!

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.560
-Love to keep them, huh?
-No!

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.000
The house is so small,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.360
and you're cluttering it with
all this useless stuff!

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.290
Remember:

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:49.409
as a man, you should be responsible.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.220
When faced with problems and difficulties,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.760
you need to solve them,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.690
not avoid or run away

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.170
from them,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.340
because that's the ultimate sign
of cowardice.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.000
Got it.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.650
Back then,

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.490
we were drawn together

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.830
by each other's shine.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.120
But after we actually got together,

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.140
all those life's trivial problems

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.240
turned everything into a mess.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.960
In endless arguments,

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.720
we slowly used up

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.159
what little love we had left.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.500
Do you blame me?

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.380
I remember

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.960
you once told me

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200
that when pruning this kind of tree,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.010
you should cut
some of the really dense leaves inside

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.480
to keep the branches airy.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.470
That way the leaves

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.250
won't yellow or wither so easily.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.720
Mu

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.810
has been spoiled by me
since she was little.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.930
In the future,

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.630
don't let her have her way in everything.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.640
Otherwise,

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.730
you'll suffer for it.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:15.440
It's fine.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.250
I'll just keep spoiling her.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.110
Here, give it to me.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.550
Are you cold?

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:35.960
No, I'm not.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:20.970
Careful.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:21.910
That one.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.300
This one, right?

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.280
Be careful.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:26.850
Okay.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.240
Here, try this one.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.190
Here, hang it here.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.560
Yes.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.840
It's crooked.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.140
See? Isn't this prettier?

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:41.350
Right?

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.980
This one is good.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.750
Zhao.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.400
What were you talking about?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.600
Really?

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:32.730
Really nothing.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.690
Are you still upset?

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.320
No, I'm not.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.410
Well...

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.910
do you want to back out?

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.070
Never.

The Chinese New Year
has brought the house to life.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.290
This is Zhao's first time
stepping into this home

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.110
and the liveliest New Year
we've had in years.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.360

We put up the Fu characters
and Spring Festival couplets together.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.410

We're all gathered together

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.600
and we have several new members.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.060
I hope that every year from now on,

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.170

be happy,

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.080
united as one family,

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.360
and celebrate Chinese New Year.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.600
Let's raise our glasses together.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.130
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.480
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.800
I spent the whole afternoon
making these dishes,

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.480
so you must finish them all.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.310
Here, have some soup first.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.290
Have some more of my homemade soup.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.270
Thank you, Mom.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.010
The second bowl is for Sophia.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.760
Yes. Beautiful.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.680
Thank you.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:42.650
Here.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.370
Chinese New Year isn't complete
without dumplings.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.970
Happy New Year.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.570
You must eat dumplings for the New Year.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:58.870
Here.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.349
Wait for me a moment.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:46.850
This—

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.000
Take it back.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.640
Since you were young,

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.450
you've never had elders around
to support you,

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.640
so you've had to rely on yourself
for everything,

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.780
and that's a lot of pressure.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:13.460
Auntie,

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:15.780
I can handle it.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.250
This is just a small token from me.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.610
You're still as stubborn as you were

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.480
when you were little.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.310
Alright then.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.050
I'll keep it for you.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:55.330
Jin Zhao.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:56.520
Uncle.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.370
Yinghan asked me to give this to you.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:07.330
This is...

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:08.720
She didn't say what it was,

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.380
just asked me to pass it to you.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.670
Take it.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.750
Alright, Uncle.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:16.980
Mom, we're leaving.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.760
When you get back, work hard,

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.680
sleep well, eat properly,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.930
and take good care of yourself.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.500
Let me know once you land safely.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.680
Remember to take good care of yourself.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.930
So that you can take care of her.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:16.670
Don't forget

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.610
what you promised me.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.130
Come.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.530
You two

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:37.890
must both be well.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.250
Thank you, Mom.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.040
It's about time.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:02.960
Go now.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:30.410
Mom, look.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:31.980
Is my drawing pretty?

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.630
So pretty, so cute.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.410
But it's still not as cute and pretty

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.270
as my daughter.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:38.780
It's wonderful.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.720
Mom, what are you doing?

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.200
I just knitted you a scarf.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.680
It's winter now.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.390
Your neck can't get cold,

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.520
so I made you a scarf.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.590
That's nice. Go play now.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.340
Zhao, you're back.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.720
Look, Mom knitted me a new scarf.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:21:59.620
Is it pretty?

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.000
Yes.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.550
I'm going to play with my friends now.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:08.830
Jin Zhao,

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:10.280
come here.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.350
Are you cold?

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.620
Are you cold?

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.790
Go do your homework.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.090
Although he's not my biological child,

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.790
I raised him with my own hands.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.390
Looking back now,

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.150
I realize that back then

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.270
I projected my resentment toward Jin Qiang

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.380
onto that little kid,

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.130
making him bear

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.990
a lot of negative emotions
he never should have had.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.130
As time passed

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.300
and I reexamined myself,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
I realized
he must have had some expectations of me.

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.480
Those days we can never return to

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.070
remain a regret.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.600
Wait here for me. I'll go get us coffee.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.160
Okay.

and yourself too.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.030
This scarf

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.610
your "yearning day and night" keychain
was worn out,

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.630
so I thought I'd get you a new one.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.500

You guys

can make up for your lack of brains
with red envelopes,

so you won't fail to win the bride.

Right, Brandy?

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.440
You can mess with us

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.020
all you want tomorrow,

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.470

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:16.200
Honestly,

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.660
I don't really know how I feel.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:19.900
You don't know?

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.330
I thought you'd say something

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.960
like nervous or excited.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.040
Yeah.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.560
People say

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:27.760
marriage is a milestone,

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:29.620
where you say goodbye to youth.

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:31.000
But for me,

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.440
the ones I love are all by my side,

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.650
and my youth

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.390
is right here with me.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:42.200
Don't worry, everyone.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.480
I've already done a lot of divinations.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.960
Tomorrow's wedding will be perfect.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.540
You don't believe me?
I can do it again right now.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.650
No need to do it.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:53.190
I'm already set on him.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.350
Then let me interview Brandy.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:32:59.330
Are you nervous?

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.920
That's a silly question.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:01.930
Well,

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.440
he's a boxer

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.720
and a racer.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:06.760
The whole world could be nervous,

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:07.960
but he won't be.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.520
The only variable

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:10.650
is you

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.320
fainting at the wedding.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:15.200
Brandy,

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.410
nervous?

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.280
A little.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:25.570
I wish you two

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.140
a marriage

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:29.060
that lasts forever.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.030
Absolutely!

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.250
Tomorrow, leave the wedding to us.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.680
It'll definitely be a success!

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:34.330
Cheers!

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.330
Come on!

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.860
Come on! Bottoms up.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:38.150
-Bottoms up!
-Cheers!

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:36.600
Time to get up.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:41.469
Pan Kai.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.840
Keep drinking!

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:46.650
Liang Yanfeng?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.360
Drink with us...

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.810
What?

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:51.710
Crazy.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.020
Crazy?

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:55.340
Lin Sui!

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.680
Sanlai!

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.190
Let me sleep a bit more.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.870
Time to get up.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.300
Sister!

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.290
Wake up! It's the wedding day.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:37.890
What?

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.000
Hello, hello. Wake up.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.690
I'm getting married.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.330
Nana! Stop sleeping, Nana.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:48.530
Nana! Nana!

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.820
I can't drink anymore!

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.290
What should we do?

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.470
My bridesmaids don't seem able to attend.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:55.160
Mine too.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.090
Just the two of us will be enough.

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:04.520
Let's elope.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.090
Where are you two going?

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:26.190
Come back!

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:28.080
