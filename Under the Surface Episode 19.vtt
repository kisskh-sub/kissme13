00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.400
Are you coming out?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.170
I've been waiting forever.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.960
Hurry up!

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.370
You wanted to see me?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.330
I'm here.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.620
Have a seat.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.320
What game are you playing today?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.400
Just catching up with an old classmate.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.400
Fine.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.520
I'm catching up with you now.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.800
So are you going to

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.120
tell me who you really are?

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.920
Who do you want

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.000
me to be?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.800
I don't care who you are,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.240
but you're definitely not Ye Zhiqiu.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.120
Don't be so sure.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200
Take a closer look at me.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.800
See who I really am.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.520
Come on, everyone, let's have a drink together.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.000
Cheers.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.690
This wine is excellent.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.280
It's quite valuable these days.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.880
Great, thank you.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.720
Then I must properly toast Director Xiang.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.180
Cheers.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.360
I'm sorry.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.040
This is Director Xiang's private collection.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.760
Do you have any idea how expensive this wine is?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.720
I'm sorry.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.160
Quickly get your manager.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.240
You must compensate and apologize.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.120
I'm sorry. It's fine.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.980
It's just wine.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.200
I'm sorry. It's okay.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.000
You can go now.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.800
It's fine.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.400
Thank you.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.800
We have plenty more wine.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800
Everyone, drink as much as you like.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.000
Come on.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.840
Let's all have a drink together.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.740
What's wrong? You don't seem very happy.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.300
Didn't enjoy the food?

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.560
Xiangyang,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.560
tonight

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.140
I discovered a different side of you.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.600
A different me?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.960
Someone who's really considerate of others,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.290
and exceptionally gentle.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.530
How gentle was I?

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.720
Well,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.290
the way you treated that server

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.560
was really kind.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.480
Because I understand their struggles.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.279
There's no need to make things difficult for them.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.080
You know that rose tattoo

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.800
on Xiaoxiao's ankle, right?

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.640
She told me

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.920
it was because of how you hurt her.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.600
Get away.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.659
What are you doing?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.320
Let me go!

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.300
Let me go! I'm on my period.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.040
Let me go!

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.480
Let go of me!

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.460
You're my wife.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.420
Can I touch you?

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.000
Can I?

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.880
Xuanxuan.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.000
We can't let this tragedy happen again.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.040
We need to make Ye Zhiqiu

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.570
see Xiangyang's true face.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.720
But how could a man who is

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.320
so gentle to waiters

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.480
be so cruel to his own wife?

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.980
Is there something hidden

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.480
behind that rose?

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.840
All these things are in the past.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.410
Let's not talk about it now.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.700
I'll be waiting for you in bed.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.280
Could it be that the you in Leng Xiaoxiao's words

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.760
isn't the real you at all?

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.420
Xiangyang.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.760
Seeing you like this,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.300
I just can't bring myself to hurt you.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.280
I think I've fallen in love with you.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.760
What should I do?

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.130
Actually, when we were in college,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.440
you already liked me.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.210
We were just too poor back then.

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.760
We had to work part-time jobs

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
just to earn enough money to live on.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.040
If we had gotten together back then,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.370
we definitely wouldn't have had a future.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.280
You're already with my senior now.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.440
What's the point of telling me all this?

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.040
Actually, I can feel it.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.720
You've never

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.320
completely let me go.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.160
Perhaps

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.840
you love me more than Xiangyang.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.340
I've had too much to drink.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.880
Xiaodi.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.960
You're drunk.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.450
Let me take you home.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.090
Have you ever thought about

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.520
being with me

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.360
and what price you'd have to pay?

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.960
Zhiqiu.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.680
But I thought I could control myself.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.820
Why are you forcing me to kill you?

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.320
We were classmates. I don't want to.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.280
But I have no choice.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.680
My hands are stained with so much blood.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.320
I can't fail now.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.760
Xiaodi.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.040
I'm sorry.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.920
You're so gentle tonight.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.160
I thought

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.320
you'd always act like a domineering CEO

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.320
toward me.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.960
Was I that rude before?

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.640
A little bit.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.440
It's like

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.800
that authoritative attitude

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.240
you have at work.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.580
Then I should really work on that.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.159
Do you enjoy

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.559
being looked up to?

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.000
Everyone wants to succeed,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.920
be respected

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.970
and recognized.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.000
Men especially need respect and admiration from women.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.760
It's normal.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.290
That's true.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.280
But Leng Xiaoxiao

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.760
and Xie Yuxuan

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.880
firmly insisted that

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.280
I shouldn't be with you.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.080
Zhiqiu.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.860
You've had such a tense relationship with the Cold family.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.880
Could it be that they wanted you dead

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.880
and Hong Ming became your scapegoat?

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.360
That's not possible.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.200
The Cold family just wanted

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.730
me to be their good laborer.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.650
How could they want me dead?

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.360
Besides,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.480
Cold Xiaoxiao

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.240
isn't a bad person by nature.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.640
She's just been spoiled.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.440
She wants everyone to revolve around her.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.000
But murder and framing others

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.660
is something she wouldn't do.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:45.920
So

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.780
you're the one with the pure heart

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.800
who always thinks the best of others.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.760
What's wrong?

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.120
Nothing.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080
I just feel that

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.040
after so many years since graduation,

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.900
we've all gone our separate ways.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.440
We've lost touch for so long,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.920
and only now do we realize

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.020
that none of us are doing well.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.920
It feels regrettable.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.890
Life is unpredictable.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.610
Some people we'll never see again.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.920
Some have left,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.690
some have disappeared.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.440
Who disappeared?

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.060
Cold Xiaoxiao and Xie Yuxuan.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.080
Since I picked you up at Yuxuan's house that time,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.740
I haven't seen either of them.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.440
I'm sorry. Please wait a moment.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.100
We're late.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.920
Please, sit down.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.450
What's going on?

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.060
It's like this, Mr. Xiang.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.640
Shi Xiaodi has been out of contact for two days since the weekend.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.560
Today is Monday and he didn't come to work.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.240
He hasn't contacted anyone either.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.440
So his family reported it to the police.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.780
These two are Officer Xu and Officer Liu.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.940
They're here to gather information.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.160
Missing?

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.700
How could he possibly be missing?

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.480
He must be playing games with me.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.560
He hasn't contacted me these past two days either.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.360
Isn't this just causing trouble for the officers?

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.480
The family reported him missing,

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.400
which meets our criteria for investigation.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.000
Mr. Xiang,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.490
was Shi Xiaodi at the office on Friday?

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.740
He was here all day.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.920
Was there anything unusual,

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.650
or did he receive any visitors?

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.480
He didn't receive any visitors.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.120
I asked him to draft a document that day.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.050
He was in the office the whole time.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.320
Officer Xu,

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.680
you've seen the relevant company footage.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.640
You've seen it yourself.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.240
If you need anything, we can send it to you.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.770
Our Mr. Xiang is quite busy.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.010
All right. We'll be in touch if needed.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:41.560
Okay.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.020
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.800
Have you found Xiaodi?

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.360
Not yet.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.360
But I've asked around

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.800
and found out he went to Kuaidi Karaoke last Friday night.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.520
He's been missing for a week now.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.760
Send someone to look for him as soon as possible.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.440
The police station is also searching.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.080
If there's any news,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.720
they'll notify us immediately.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.760
Report to me as soon as you hear anything.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.490
Understood.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.560
This person passed by

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.240
at around 9 o'clock.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.040
Fast forward, please.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.480
OK.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.160
Stop.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.580
Did you get a clear look at this woman?

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.000
Since she was a VIP room guest,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.460
I paid special attention.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.560
I happened to see her that day.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.000
The impression was very strong.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.840
What I mean is

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.200
this woman looked

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.120
just like a celebrity.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.320
Ye Zhiqiu.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.860
Is this the person?

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.290
Yes, that's her.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.280
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.520
That night

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.720
you were clearly having dinner with me.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.520
How is that possible?

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.640
Are there really

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.840
people who look so similar in this world?

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.970
Is this a conspiracy

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.900
or just a coincidence?

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.440
The police are now

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.600
looking everywhere for Shi Xiaodi.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.800
What happened to him?

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.720
Keep your voice down.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.600
I'm not deaf.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.000
Xiaoxiao.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.800
What did you promise me?

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.500
How could you go back on your word?

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.610
Are you still the Leng Xiaoxiao I knew?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.130
Don't start questioning me the moment you arrive, okay?

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.020
Think about what you've done.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.440
Why have things come to this?

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.800
It's your indecisiveness

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.480
that forced me to protect you

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.920
and repeatedly

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.810
push the boundaries of the law.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.090
Do you think I wanted to do this?

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.840
But Shi Xiaodi is like a dangerous wave

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.480
silently following you.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.890
Ready to pounce and destroy you at any moment.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.160
But Xiaoxiao,

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.120
the police are looking everywhere for Shi Xiaodi.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.160
Do we have any way out?

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.600
The police will solve the case soon.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.240
We don't have much time left.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.400
We need to create an accident quickly

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.620
to kill Xiangyang.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.160
After we get the property, we can be ourselves again.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.890
This is our only way to survive.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:27.880
Do we

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.840
have no other options?

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.680
What do you think?

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.840
Shelly disappeared a month ago.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.760
The person she was in closest contact with before disappearing

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:43.920
[Classmate]

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.780
was Shi Xiaodi.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.520
Besides, there were also Xiangyang and Ye Zhiqiu.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.200
Shelly is missing too.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.480
There really are such coincidences in this world.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.000
There's an even bigger coincidence.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.280
Shi Xiaodi and Xiangyang

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.360
are from Binjiang University's Economics Department.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.600
Shelly and Ye Zhiqiu

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.040
[Missing]

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.080
are classmates at Binjiang University's Film Academy

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.140
and roommates too.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.280
Ye Zhiqiu.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.010
Ye Zhisi.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.480
Summon Ye Zhiqiu immediately.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.340
Have her come in for questioning.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.080
Why did you decide

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.210
to bring me here for dinner?

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.920
You forgot.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.920
This is where we had

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.770
our graduation dinner.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.320
Please enjoy your meal.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.450
What are your plans after graduation?

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.320
I plan to move to Beijing.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.520
I want to try

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.850
to see if I can make it

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.920
in that city.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.680
Want me to go to Beijing with you?

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.280
Better not.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.660
Xiangyang.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:52.960
Neither of us

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.820
can afford to fail.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.220
We carry more than just

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.560
our own futures,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.490
but also our families' expectations.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.130
Your aunt and sister

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.440
have sacrificed so much for you.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.820
Only by choosing Xiaoxiao

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.220
can you repay them sooner.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.180
Besides, Xiaoxiao

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.560
really likes you.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.890
You two are a good match.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.450
This is the path we should take.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.700
Oh, I almost forgot

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.200
about this.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.420
I'll never forget.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.320
By the way,

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.860
have you found Shi Xiaodi?

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:46.840
Not yet.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.640
Xiaodi's situation is quite bizarre.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.500
Have you ever seen women who look identical?

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.320
You mean twins?

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.720
Do you have a twin sister?

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.119
No,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.319
I'm an only child.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.280
But

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.720
before Xiaodi died, she saw someone

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.040
who looked exactly like you

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.440
dining in a private room.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.040
Before at Cloud Restaurant,

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.200
it was just the back view that resembled you.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.530
But this woman Xiaodi saw before she died,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.960
her profile is clearly visible in the security footage,

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.619
and she really looks like you.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:31.840
It's possible

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.260
someone had plastic surgery to look like me.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.160
You know how

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.780
some fans can be quite obsessive.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.210
That's actually possible.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:46.720
Hello.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.840
We're from Binjiang Police Station.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.280
Are you Ms. Ye Zhiqiu?

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.160
According to regulations, you're being summoned to Lingjiang Branch of Binjiang Public Security Bureau for questioning.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:17:59.760
Yes, I am.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.840
Then please come with us.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:21.450
Plan.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.040
Sketch.
