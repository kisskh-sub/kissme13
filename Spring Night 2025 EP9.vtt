00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.920
You all right?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.960
I'm fine.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.720
Come, get up.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.040
So it was you

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.240
who insulted my wife?

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.400
You lowly commoner.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.160
How dare you talk like this?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.880
Your Honor. By the laws,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.200
any dispute

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.640
must hear both sides.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.280
Why do you take only one side?

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.400
I am a juren scholar,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.960
steeped in books and learning.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.200
But you

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.240
are nothing but illiterate peasants.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.120
Whose words are more credible

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.360
is obvious.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.960
A so-called scholar

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.120
calls people "peasants" at every turn.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.920
Your learning can't be much to speak of.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.960
I honestly wonder how you placed first.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.040
Are you doubting my talent?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.320
Dare to wager with me?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.800
How?

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.520
Half an incense stick.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.160
We each write a poem.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.440
If mine is worse,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.800
I'll let this matter go

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.280
and give up my juren scholar's title.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.640
But if yours loses,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.360
your punishment will be fifty lashes.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.320
No!

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.960
I accept.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.440
Your Honor, please be the judge.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.760
Alright.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.160
Ye Wuming is up
against a jieyuan scholar.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.840
Mai Tian's family is in trouble now.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.560
You're doomed.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.480
Your Honor, I've finished.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.400
Good.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.680
One by one they come,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.720
thin-feathered, sharp-tongued.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.200
Eager to soar, but never far.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.480
Pointed beaks,
eager to sing, but never true.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.880
Hmph.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.080
It's sparrows.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.240
(Luckily, few in Penglai Village
are literate.)

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.480
(Just a bunch of uneducated villagers.)

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.720
(Any scribble will fool them.)

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.120
What's so funny?

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.480
Forget

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.040
the poem itself.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.400
Your handwriting

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.840
is terrible.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.560
I... I...

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.720
Enough with the glib talk!

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.240
Where's your poem?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.640
At the doors of power, gold runs deep.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.240
Hollow titles dress the walls,
a lie believed.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.240
No ink in the heart,
a counterfeit top rank,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.440
stinking of money,
yet he claims success.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.760
It's you.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.280
- Well said!
- Great!

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.120
How incisive!

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.960
Truly well-aimed.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.120
You dare mock me?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.800
Poetry is written

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.040
from whatever comes to mind.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.360
You don't even know that?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.800
You!

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.600
(So what?)

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.600
(In the end,)

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.360
(it's still the magistrate who decides.)

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.920
Your Honor.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.960
Both poems are done.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.240
Please give your judgment.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.280
There's nothing more to discuss.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.280
Scholar Liu's poem is refined
and brilliant.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.680
Ye Wuming's is confused
and poorly expressed.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.960
Naturally, Scholar Liu wins.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.080
This is blatant injustice!
What a rotten magistrate!

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.920
Silence!

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.040
What do you villagers know about poems?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.880
Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.600
A backwater bumpkin

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.160
dreams of playing the hero.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.280
Ridiculous.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.800
Guards! Drag Mai Tian out!

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.280
Fifty lashes!

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.400
You...

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.120
Wait!

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.480
I wrote the poem.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.880
If there's punishment, I'll take it.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.040
You say you'll take it?

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.440
Who do you think you are?

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.240
Your Honor.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.200
This man used poetry to ridicule me.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.840
I have a request.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.080
Go on.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.320
If this wretch

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.280
whips himself

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.760
in front of everyone,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.520
I ask that he be allowed

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.440
to take the punishment in her place.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.280
Guards!

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.680
It's fine. I can take it.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.680
Hit hard! Make it bleed.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.080
No blood doesn't count.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.680
One.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.560
Two.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.680
Ye Wuming.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.880
I've never seen

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.400
someone whip himself before.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.960

How could you be so foolish?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.080
I'm fine.

Mai Tian.

I can take it.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.240
I'm not done yet.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.480
Brother, please stop!

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.600
Do you truly

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.280
only see me as your brother?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.680
How dull.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.560
Do the whipping myself
may be more interesting.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.800
Let go!

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.680
Whip me!

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.680
Let go!

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.520
Acting out a tragic scene?

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.960
What a pity.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.920
I hate that the most.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.000
Insolent peasant! Do you know who I am?

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.720
I'm a disciple of Prime Minister!

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.560
Shut up.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.360
Prime Minister would never associate
with someone like you.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.120
I'll report this to the court,
strip you of your title

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.200
and deal with your crimes.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.280
Get out!

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.880
Why are you so silly?

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.680
It's okay. Just surface wounds.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.880
Let me tell you.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.920
Liu Chen is nothing but a waste.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.960
He couldn't even lay a finger on me.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.400
It doesn't hurt anymore.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.480
See? I can still move.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.600
You...

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.880
Sister, here's the healing ointment.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.240
Apply it for Wuming.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.600
Hurry!

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.400
Well, when dad gets back,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.760
let him do it.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.680
Who knows when dad will be back?

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.120
Wuming is badly injured.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.920
Right?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.040
Right. Exactly.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:47.720
See?

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.200
He's in so much pain.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.160
Hurry up and do it.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.320
I'll step out now.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.320
Alright, I'll apply it.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.240
It might hurt.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.760
I haven't started.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.520
I...

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.920
I'm just testing it.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.480
Don't yell. Is it really that painful?

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.360
You... You're hurt there too?

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.640
Yes, I guess.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.280
Stop!

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.080
Mai Tian, give me the ointment.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.840
I'll apply it for him.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.280
Okay.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.160
Mai Tian.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.480
Dad, I'm injured.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.680
It really hurts.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.400
Don't worry.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.000
I've been putting medicine
on people for years.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.200
It always hurts.
