[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.720
[Episode 25]

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.060
Still running a fever?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.680
Feel it yourself.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.190
Let's go in.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.310
Moonlight. Not on the menu.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.720
Try it.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.510
Watching them prepare crabs

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.480
reminds me of our childhood.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.550
Every Mid-Autumn Festival,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.950
Mom would buy crabs for us too.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.280
I still have a box at home.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.890
You're taking me to your home?

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.320
You've been here before?

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.380
Let's go.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.390
Do you have any women's slippers?

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.110
The ones Dr. Julia wears.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.950
Would you like to wear them?

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.920
I'll stick with these, then.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.190
Did you

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.030
buy this place or rent it?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.270
I bought it.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.800
Looks like you're doing pretty well.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.950
Then you wouldn't mind

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.550
if I just look around, right?

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.230
Wait.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.080
Are you hiding someone here?

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.640
Didn't you already run into one before?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.800
Dr. Julia looks really good for her age.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.560
She's over 50 but looks like she's 30.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.390
I thought she was your wife.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.810
You've got quite the imagination.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040
I'm going in then.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.210
Just messing with you.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.730
I grew up with your pranks.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.600
Let me help too.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:17.680
You know how?

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.070
I have to.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.440
No one has taken care of me
all these years.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.900
I'd have starved to death
if I couldn't cook.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.920
No one to take care of you?

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.880
No one has

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.040
pursued you all these years?

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.680
Quite a few.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.040
Then why didn't you date anyone?

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.070
I did.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.600
One of them was even in a rock band.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.680
Once,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.750
he took me to a remote mountain area

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.540
where there was a frozen lake.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.710
He jumped right in

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.280
and wanted me to jump in too.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.600
Seriously?

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.000
Will you believe anything I say?

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.820
Running out of things to talk about, huh?

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.620
No, I've got plenty more.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.070
[Sanlai]

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:24.390
Brandy.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.360
If you're not coming over,
we'll come to you.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.390
About two hours.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.150
It's no fun being alone
during the holiday.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:32.480
I'm not alone right now.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:33.380
Sorry,

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.370
I forgot about Lightning.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.809
Anyway, don't worry. We'll be there soon.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:45.580
Sorry, dude.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.860
I'm hanging up now. Sorry to bother you.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.960
My lifelong reputation

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.530
is ruined by you.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.510
I'll take responsibility for that.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.800
What would you like to drink?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.610
I'll have some of your wine.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.840
You want to drink?

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.390
Can't I?

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.330
What will you have?

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.440
I'll just have water.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.320
How's your mom?

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.620
Her health has improved a lot.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.270
All these years in Canada,

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.510
I've been taking her
to follow-up appointments.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.960
She's gradually gotten used to life there.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.980
For me?

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.750
I like to dip my crab in vinegar.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.650
After all these years,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.390
he's still as attentive as ever.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.520
Don't drink too much.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.470
Don't expect me to take care of you
if you get drunk.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.460
You used to say that too.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.270
Zhao.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.690
Brother...

00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:59.520
No.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.080
Jin Zhao.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:02.910
Considering you went through

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.110
something this big without telling me,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.930
I've decided

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.200
to disown you as my sibling.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.150
Cheers.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.880
You know I'm still an intern, right?

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.550
The internship salary is really low.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.880
Every month, I have to pay for rent,

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.740
water, electricity, and gas.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.320
When I was in school,

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.330
Mom always supported me financially.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.780
Now that I'm on my own,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.230
I can't keep asking her for money.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.560
I feel like I can barely
afford to eat anymore.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.050
You want to borrow some money?

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.280
I want to move in with you.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.630
No way.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.320
Why not?

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.010
You're living alone anyway.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.020
If I move in,

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.080
I can help with your living expenses.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.010
And although I'm just an intern now

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.050
and don't make much,

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.450
once I become permanent,

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.750
I'll make more, and I can scrimp and save

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.900
to contribute to household expenses.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.610
Thanks for your kind offer.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.010
But who knows who'll be supporting whom?

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.390
No.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.240
Zhao, hear me out.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.500
That roommate of mine—

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.050
he disappears every night

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.510
and always plays weird music in the room.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.270
It really affects my work.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.350
I honestly just want to
move somewhere else.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.060
You haven't changed your old habits.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.880
Once you come over,
you cling to me and won't leave.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.340
I'm not clinging to other people.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.600
When I was sending Jiang Mu off just now,

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.750
I told her straight—

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.880
if you don't want her

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:00.920
or if she's not happy there,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.160
come back, and I'll take her.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.680
Guess what she said?

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.790
She said you

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.690
would never abandon her.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.950
You've really made up your mind?

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.490
When her mom was pregnant with her...

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.830
her mom's health was never good.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.420
She was born prematurely,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.600
at eight months.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.990
She weighed just over 4 jin at birth.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.380
Her dad and I

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.490
watched her lying in the incubator
through the glass.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.560
I thought to myself then...

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:00.780
such a tiny baby,

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.120
could we keep her alive?

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.600
So when we were kids,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.750
whenever possible,

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.630
I always gave in to her.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.800
Because I always felt

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.370
it was already a miracle
that she was alive.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.000
She was picky about food,

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.730
ate very little...

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.910
and always caught colds and fevers.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.480
Every change of season,

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.320
we'd take her to the hospital.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.380
She cried a lot too.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.120
Even a tiny bug...

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.230
would frighten her to tears.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.640
Then she'd reach out for me to hold her.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.390
But she was easy to comfort.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.450
Just distract her

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.740
and talk about something else,
and she'd smile.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.680
When I was little, I thought that

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.510
if she ever wanted to get married...

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.160
she should find someone
who understands her,

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.630
knows her temperament,

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:12.780
can comfort her,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.210
and knows what she likes to eat,

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:17.830
what she doesn't eat,

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.510
what she fears...

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.060
and what she hates.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.120
If she ever ended up with someone

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.790
who made her suffer,

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.880
I'd beat that bastard to death.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.150
Sanlai.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.710
I can't keep her by my side.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.880
I can't let suffer because of me,
even a little bit.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.800
I can't make her life difficult.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.839
I can't be that bastard.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.520
The moon is so round
and beautiful tonight.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.280
Look over there. Over there.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.520
Let me ask you something.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.440
When you went back last time...

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.690
Jin Qiang didn't give you
my contact info...

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.080
right?

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.730
He said

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.210
you haven't been back for many years.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.120
You two wouldn't have

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
conspired to deceive me, would you?

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:56.950
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.370
The sun shines by day...

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.390
and the moon by night.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.990
No problem.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.430
It's settled then.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:54.560
I'll head off first.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.280
How's that?
Pretty thoughtful of me, right?

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.560
I know you've been swamped lately.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.280
Thought I'd pull you out
for some fresh air.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.360
Thanks a lot.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.520
Don't mention it.
The leaders will be here shortly.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.710
The building we're visiting now

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:22.110
was constructed in 1929.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:23.150
It has a long history

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:25.600
and is our country's
first modern observatory.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.150
Located on the peak of Purple Mountain,

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:29.470
it embodies
a strong traditional Chinese aesthetic.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.470
Next, we'll

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.910
visit the summit.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.230
Here we have
the 60-centimeter reflecting telescope

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.080
at the summit of Purple Mountain.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.470
This reflecting telescope

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:38.760
dates back to 1934.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.410
Its focal length...

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.380
Let's go inside for a closer look.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.650
[Jin Zhao]

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.880
When do you get off work?

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.190
I'm showing some visitors around
the observatory.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.920
It'll be over in a little while.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.120
Then carry on with your work.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:04.990
Jiang Mu.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.950
They have other plans for tonight.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.410
We just need to see them off
to their vehicle.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.870
Want to have hot pot together tonight?

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.350
I already have plans.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.660
Alright then.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:17.720
Let's go.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.250
Let's go.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.630
Listen, don't always
bury yourself in work.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:29.160
You're not getting any younger.
Consider finding a boyfriend.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.710
Why are you here?

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:35.550
Didn't I tell you to wait for me

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.550
-at the foot of the mountain?
-I wanted to come see you.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.180
How did you get up here?

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:45.880
By cable car.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.460
Why are you making such a fuss
about him coming up the mountain?

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.670
Who is this?

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.470
My name is Gu Zhijie.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:57.630
I'm Jiang Mu's

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:58.910
half-colleague?

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.120
And this is?

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:04.990
My ex-boyfriend of one week.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:07.370
I've heard a lot about you.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.950
What do you mean by "half-colleague"?

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.280
I'm Jiang Mu's senior from school.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.560
Although we don't work together,

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.020
I kind of tricked her into
coming to Nanjing.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.550
We're all in the same field,

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.470
so we're half-colleagues.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.390
Qin and I will
see the leaders off tonight.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:26.560
You're really not
coming to dinner tonight?

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.910
I'll call you later.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.090
Okay.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.020
Then I'll get back to work.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:38.510
Half-colleague.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.270
Is this your first time up here?

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.480
Want me to give you a tour?

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.330
If it's convenient for you.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.840
Convenient or not, you're already here.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.100
Wouldn't it be a waste not to look around?

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:57.490
I already told you.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.480
I just came to see you.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:02.280
To see me?

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:04.960
So, what have you observed?

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.560
I came to see...

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.540
if I've scared you away again.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.800
And what's your conclusion?

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.080
This celestial globe before us

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.360
is cast in bronze

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:36.520
and can rotate.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.330
It's about three chi in diameter

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.190
and is embedded with

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.080
1,449 bronze pins,

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.520
representing the stars

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.920
visible to the naked eye.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:47.910
Is this ring

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:49.390
the meridian circle?

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.320
That's right.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.230
Mr. Visitor, you know your astronomy.

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:58.170
Just a little.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.710
This is a celestial globe,

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.390
called Huntianyi or Hunxiang
in ancient times.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.080
Back in the Eastern Han Dynasty,

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.230
there was a star-gazing boy

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.090
named Zhang Heng who improved it,

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:14.880
giving it the function

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.410
of demonstrating celestial body movements.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.950
My work focuses on

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.600
the dynamics of

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.400
multi-body celestial systems.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.040
Come to think of it,

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.220
you were actually the one
who first introduced me to all this.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.680
Have you been busy lately?

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.100
Let me ask you something.

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:49.320
If I really had a fiancé

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.930
who loved playing games

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.600
and chasing women,

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:54.020
what would you do?

00:33:58.290 --> 00:33:59.490
Do you want the truth?

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:00.390
Of course.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:03.890
I'd make you willingly...

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.020
dump him before the wedding.

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:12.159
Willingly dump him?

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.710
And be with you instead?

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.480
Let me ask you another question.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:35.810
What if I really got scared off

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:38.449
after seeing that report?

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:46.159
Then I should...

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.290
still be able to catch the last cable car
down the mountain.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.070
So...

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:14.810
have you made up your mind?

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.730
I want to take you somewhere first.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.760
Do you see that?

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:31.880
Every year at this time,

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.200
the Earth's orbit around the Sun

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.030
and the Moon's orbit around the Earth

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.430
undergo slight changes.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.160
The moon and sun

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.480
appear simultaneously on the horizon,

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:45.990
creating the phenomenon
of the sun and moon shining together.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.890
The sun and moon alternate.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.430
Even natural laws aren't absolute,

00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.850
let alone people.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.650
Do you get...

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:17.410
what I'm trying to say?

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:27.620
The sun shines by day,

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.960
and the moon by night.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.390
The sun and moon shine together.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.750
You and I

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:42.200
will never be apart.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.240
This is my answer.
