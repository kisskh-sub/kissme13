Zhuang,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.080
since when did you become
such a fan of overtime?

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.300

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.680

Research Report
on Shuangyuan Photovoltaic Loan.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.520
The loan for Shengyuan's

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.360
Suzhou subsidiary?

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.500
Honestly, this case

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:58.780
doesn't seem worth the overtime.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.600
I know

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.920
they sent you down for a site visit,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.400
but word is,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.180
the boss

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.420
isn't exactly eager
to greenlight the loan.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.120
According to the grapevine,

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.220
Shengyuan's own stance is pretty vague.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.340
They did send over

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.480
a new Deputy GM,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.160
but it's basically an exile.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.079
Word has it he's

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.640
Mr. Sheng Xianmin's grandson,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.500
who used to manage

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.760
their BD team.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.480
Total eye candy.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.680
Too bad

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.260
he's a Lin instead of a Sheng.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.060
So, it's him.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.300
He went to Suzhou Shuangyuan?

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.860
What,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.740
you know the guy?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.420
Mr. Song once took me
to Shengyuan for a visit.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.280
I met him then.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.200
How do you always have the inside scoop

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.020
on everything?

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.420
I've built a strong reputation

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.579
for networking.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.820
Strictly speaking,

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.180
you should know Shengyuan

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.220
better than I do.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.600
Don't you have a stunning classmate

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.200
working there?

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.180
The one

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.300
you grabbed dinner with the other day.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.860
I was just wondering

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.060
why you're so invested in this report.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.840
Is it because of her?

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.520
I care about it because the boss

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.980
signs my paycheck.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.460
What's going on?

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.360
Don't tell me

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.240
it's that pretty classmate of yours.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.920
No.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.740
She calls and you shut
your computer right away?

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.440
Wow, she really ranks higher
than we do, huh?

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.320
I'm just grabbing something.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.800
I'll be right back.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.140
Welcome.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.240
That was fast.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.440
I was settling in for a long wait.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.840
Since my mom asked for your help,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.840
I didn't want to keep you waiting.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.920
Did you go back to Nanjing yesterday?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.880
Yeah.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Then why are you back so soon?

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.520
My boss suddenly announced

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.440
a team-building event for tomorrow.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.380
You know,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.520
he's the grandson

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.380
of the Shengyuan founder,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.380
just back from studying abroad.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.240
He's full of these trendy ideas,

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.740
and it's exhausting
for those of us working under him.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.420
So, I rushed back

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.120
right after dinner

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.540
and came straight here
from the train station.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:18.300
Here are the things
your mom asked me to bring you.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.560
She could have just couriered them.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.560
I hate to trouble you like this.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.140
Don't be like that.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.960
We've been helping each other out

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.040
and carrying stuff back and forth

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.160
since we were kids.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.420
It's

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.540
a funny coincidence

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.180
that even now,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.460
our jobs still keep us so close
to each other.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.560
Thanks.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.760
Let me buy you a coffee.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.140
Sure.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.020
I'll have a latte

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.440
and an order

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.780

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.240
Sorry,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.159

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.920

Coming right up.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.240
Actually, I wanted to ask you

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.820
about something else.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.600
What is it?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.540
Have you been in touch

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.800
with Zhuo Hui much lately?

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.040
A bit.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.780
Siliang asked me to check in.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.420
She feels like

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.300
he's been acting differently

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.100
towards her,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.640
like his heart's not really
in it anymore.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.100
She's just wondering

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.720
if there's someone else

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.500
in the picture.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.260
He met me for drinks last week.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.420
Siliang's name never came up.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.940
He didn't mention anyone else, either.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.640
Siliang never agreed

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.420
to be with him.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.100
It's only natural for feelings

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.820
to die down.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.600
That's true.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.760
Now that we're out in the real world,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.400
there are just way too many temptations.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.080
Siliang should have
made up her mind sooner.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.000

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.880
and secure my future here.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.040
Everything else is secondary.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.420
I missed out
on the strawberry mille-feuille.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.400
I mean, who does that?

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.300
Buying out every last one?

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.660
A walk is exactly what I needed.

I'm about to burst.

nearly hit the floor.

We ate all that

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.980
and still got doggy bags.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.800
It's not every day we're in Shanghai.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.160
It was so tasty.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.460
I had to bring some back

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.880
for the team.

Let's just grab a cab to the station.

With all this cake,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.660

It was so worth it.

Totally.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.700
I could honestly do

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.540
a Shanghai food run every week.

Okay.

How long do you think
it'll take to get one?

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:50.020
We'll

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.560
get one for sure,
as we're right under the overpass.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.560
he will stand right where I am now.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.080
Yet, at this very moment,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.120
our paths don't cross.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.960
And he will never know

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.260
that I was here,

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.260
imagining the moment we finally meet.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.300
♪May this silent wish of mine♪

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.360
A penny for your thoughts?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.040
It's nothing.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.680
I just feel like

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.580
running into someone in Shanghai

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.680
is nearly impossible.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.140
So that's why you came here today?

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.300
Hoping to bump into someone?

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.320
Actually, I'm not.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.700
This is enough.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.460
I don't get it.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.100
You've completely lost me.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.660
That's fine.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:54.780
Doesn't matter anymore.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.060
Alright,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.260
let's head back.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.600
You've been keeping up
with your rehab, right?

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.760
Are you still doing

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.460
those bean-sorting exercises

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.640
I gave you?

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.480
Yes.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.280
Good. Lift.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.020
Extend.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.380
Make a fist.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:47.980
Alright.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.620
I take it you're not

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.120
feeling any numbness or pain

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.860
during the day anymore?

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:52.560
None at all.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.800
But by the third round of the beans,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.000
I still break into a sweat

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.220
and my hand starts to tremble a bit.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.340
Once a day

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.800
is plenty.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.180
Don't push yourself.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.520
The good news

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.020
is that for an average person,

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.020
your left hand

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.200
has recovered

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.060
remarkably well.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:12.760
But...

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:19.820
Dr. Lin.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.740
I knew it was you.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.020
I recognized you from behind.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.120
Are you back at the hospital?

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.640
Dr. Zhong, long time no see.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:26.920
Just a follow-up visit.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.540
All finished now.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.860
Are you heading to the lot
across the street to get your car?

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.560
Why didn't you just park
at the hospital?

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.900
It's a bit of a hike
to walk all that way.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.600
I've resigned.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.320
I'm sure my plates have been cleared
from the system by now.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.250
[Shuangyuan Photovoltaic]

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.300
Thanks for grinding through
this week's inventory.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:08.960
No worries.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.120
I've got something to tell everyone.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.220
The day before yesterday, Mr. Lin
had a bit of an accident in Shanghai.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.880
May Mr. Lin Yusen vanish at top speed.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.520
Is he okay?

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.020
He's fine,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.560
nothing too serious.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.520
But he injured his foot

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.860
and needs to rest for a while.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.240
I'll be taking over Mr. Lin's work

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.140
for the month,

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.800
but he still needs

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.800
to review and weigh in

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.740
on the plant expansion

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.380
and financing.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.900
So, I need someone

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.700
to handle the document runs
to and from his house.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.500
It won't be anything too frequent,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.020
maybe once or twice a week.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.000
Who's up for it?

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.540
Mr. Zhang,

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:02.980
I'll do it.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.960
First of all, I've been following up

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.660
on the expansion project

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.860
from the start.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.340
And

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.780
as everyone knows,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.740
Mr. Lin has
a pretty bad impression of me.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.300
So I want to take this opportunity

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.400
to change

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.400
how he sees me.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.560
And maybe ease

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.880
my guilty conscience a little.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.380
Alright.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.460
You're on.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.040
Thank you.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.220
Number 26.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.400
Hello, ma'am.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.020
Is this the residence

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.380
of Mr. Lin Yusen?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:11.960
Yes, it is.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.340
You're from Mr. Lin's company, right?

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.840
He's waiting in the study.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.500
Please, come in.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:22.680
Ma'am.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.580
How's Mr. Lin

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.780
feeling?

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:27.800
Is everything okay?

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.980
What did the doctor say?

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.260
He's fine.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.200
It's nothing serious.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.340
It just flared up

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.320
an old injury.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.900
The doctor says
he should really rest up,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
so it can heal for good.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.120
So for now, no more walking around,

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.360
and he can't stand for too long.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:40.760
He can't even walk?

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.580
Are my wishes really this powerful?

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.160
I wanted him out of the office,
and he's gone.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.160
and in such a brutal way.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.720
Darn it.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.380
Am I really about to face my "victim"?

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.680
Wait, maybe it's not a good time

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720
for me to go in?

00:14:59.060 --> 00:14:59.600
Ma'am,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:00.720
would you mind

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.140
just handing these documents

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:02.900
to Mr. Lin for me?

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.420
I'll check with Mr. Lin.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.740
Just a moment, young lady.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.360
Who's there?

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.580
Mr. Lin,

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.160
it's someone from your office.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.700
A very pretty young lady.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.900
She's here to drop off
some documents for you.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.360
Do you want her to come in,

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.220
or should I just bring them to you?

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:19.820
Let her in.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.740
You can go on in.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.780
I'll go get you a glass of water.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.460
Mr. Lin.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:54.520
It's you.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.600
No one else was available.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:13.660
Ms. Chen,

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:15.460
show her to the living room.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.100
Of course.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.160
Young lady,

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.500
Mr. Lin said

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.960
to bring the documents

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.060
on this list over tomorrow.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.660
I have to come back again tomorrow?

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.480
That's what Mr. Lin said.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.040
Mr. Lin,

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.560
here are the documents

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.460
you asked for yesterday.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.040
I'll wait outside.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.220
Mr. Lin,

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.760
I forgot my phone.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.380
Would you mind if I read the magazines

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.560
on the coffee table?

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.320
You wouldn't be interested.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.500
They're all medical journals.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.400
I'll wait outside, then.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.900
Here, have some fruit.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.100
Thank you, ma'am.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.620
Mr. Lin subscribed

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.380
to these magazines a long time ago.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.480
He signed up for several years at once

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.280
and never let the subscriptions lapse.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.980
I brought them back

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.840
from Shanghai,

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.240
though I'm not sure

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.720
if he still reads them.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.900
Mr. Lin must have been

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.840
a very dedicated doctor.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.280
He's been exceptionally bright
and hardworking

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.220
since he was a child.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.720
Everyone used to call him a genius.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.160
It's such a pity.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:55.840
Come here.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:13.860
Mr. Lin,

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.400
you wanted to see me?

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.580
Stay here in the study.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.100
I'll have questions

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.340
for you as I go.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.400
Okay.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.780
Ms. Chen is heading back

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.440
to Shanghai tomorrow afternoon,

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:37.500
so you'll need to let yourself in.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.080
I'll have her

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.000
give you a spare key card
before you leave.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.560
Wait, what?

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.580
I'm just here
to drop off some documents.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.780
Why am I getting a key card?

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.760
Wouldn't that be

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.200
a little inappropriate?

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.020
Unless

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.240
you expect me to get the door?

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.100
Of course not.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.020
Wait a second.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.960
If I have to come back tomorrow,

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.680
that'll be

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.820
three days in a row at Mr. Lin's house.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.520
My colleagues at the office...?

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.420
Nie,

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.680
Mr. Lin needs

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.420
to sign this document.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.960
And this one too.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.320
It's urgent, Xiguang.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.460
Tell him

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.780
it needs to be done today.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:45.980
Wait,

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.200
why is everyone just handing
everything to me?

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:53.620
Xiguang,

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.020
I'll keep it a secret, I promise.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.540
Just tell me.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.960
Is there something going on

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.860
between you and Mr. Lin?

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.440
Mr. Lin,

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.740
[Nie Xiguang]
it's Nie Xiguang.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.720
May I come in now?

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:37.640
[Mr. Lin]
Yes.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:22:59.880
Have a seat.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.580
Mr. Lin,

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.080
would you like some water?

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.540
Mr. Lin,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.080
it'll just be a few minutes.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.540
There's no boiled water left,
so I need to put some on.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.020
I added some ice cubes from the fridge,

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.040
so it's not too hot.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.160
You can drink it now.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.640
Nie Xiguang.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.000
Why do you feel so guilty?

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.340
What...?

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.600
Your face gives you away.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.640
I've felt your guilt

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.160
since the very first day you came here.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:38.540
Why is that?

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.640
I...

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.320
I didn't mean to curse you.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.440
And how am I even supposed
to answer that?

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.060
"I cursed you at the temple

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.020
and then you got hurt?"

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.880
That sounds so superstitious.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.540
Nie Xiguang.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.060
This is my second accident.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.140
The first

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.520
ended my career.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.940
Your...

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.220
My left hand.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.000
If this accident

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.340
could trigger

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.500
some long-forgotten memory in you...

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.740
I would be very happy.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.140
Long-forgotten memory?

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.800
Mr. Lin, what are you talking about?

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.620
You can go now.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.900
Leave the key card
on the entryway table.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:13.780
You don't need to come back anymore.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.340
I'm just cooperating
with the investigation.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.220
I'm not a criminal,

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.580
so show some respect.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.660
Thank you.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.040
What are these documents?

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.140
These are for Mr. Lin to sign tomorrow.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.040
Mr. Zhang suggested

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.260
that Mr. Lin should still review them,

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.060
so I'll leave them with you.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:18.920
Mr. Wang,

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.280
these are the documents for Mr. Lin.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.400
He told me I'm not needed there anymore,

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.420
so I'm leaving them here.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:26.500
What happened?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.940
You're not going tomorrow?

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.860
Mr. Lin said he doesn't need me

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.240
to drop things off anymore.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.280
Out of the blue? Why the sudden change?

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.200
Xiguang,

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:36.960
did you offend

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.100
him again?

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.760
It seems so.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.120
What did you do this time?

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.580
I have no idea.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.760
I've been racking my brain
all the way here,

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.740
finished my milk tea,

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.460
and still couldn't figure out

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.940
how I offended him.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.100
He won't be around
for the next couple of days,

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.240
so I'm going to relax.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.220
Once he's back,

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.140
the overtime nightmare

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.620
starts all over again.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.140
Wang Qi, here are the documents.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:11.920
Xiguang,

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.480
I was trying to reach you.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.120
Why didn't you pick up?

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.340
I was dropping off
documents for Mr. Lin,

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.380
so I had my phone on silent.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:24.500
Did you just get back?

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.940
Did you see Mr. Mo

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.660
on your way in?

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.800
I did.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.100
What's up with him?

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.040
That didn't look good at all.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.840
Well, I've got some massive news!

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.420
I'm treating you and Dan
to a nice dinner

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.540
at Jinji Lake tonight.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:39.880
Yin Jie,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.940
you and Yuhua should come along.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.800
You know Mr. Mo's relative,

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.940
the one who tried to snatch your dorm?

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.380
Well, he's finally toast.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.420
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:50.680
Qiqi,

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.060
tell us what happened.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:52.900
Administration

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.900
hasn't leaked a single word.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.340
Mr. Mo was taken away.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.660
I got word from Mr. Wu.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.340
He knew how much grief
they gave me last time.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.160
Apparently, Shengyuan's internal audit

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.360
uncovered something from way back,

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.740
when Mr. Mo was still with them.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:05.980
Something about malpractice
and taking kickbacks.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.220
So people from HQ showed up

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.160
and took him away.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:09.840
Mr. Wu said

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.380
they might have gone
straight to the police.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.480
Plainclothes officers came

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:13.880
and hauled him off.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.220
But whatever the case,

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.740
he's most likely not coming back.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.040
For us,

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.220
this is sweet revenge.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.580
It feels so good!

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.500
Cheers!

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.880
- Cheers to that!
- Come on!

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.820
I know I messed up

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.600
that payment last time, and I own that.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.300
But they were trying to make Finance

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.880
take the whole fall?

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.140
That was way out of line.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:35.800
Exactly.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.580
That's just how Procurement rolls.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.940
HQ took him away?

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.780
So it has nothing to do
with our company?

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.500
When one falls, the rest follow.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.140
He's definitely dirty.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.040
An internal audit

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:49.880
is coming for our company for sure.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.300
When the auditors get here,

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.420
I'll give them my full cooperation

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.340
and even volunteer for overtime.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.140
My ex-ally is the real deal.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.480
He made his move so fast.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.460
Wait, what did you say?

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.480
You mean your ex-boyfriend?

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.900
Don't talk nonsense.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.740
I've never been in a relationship.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.000
I meant

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.200
there's a NPC

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.980
who's a total beast.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.500
He crushed a "monster" in game

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.980
that used to bully me.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.460
So even though his "quests"

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:24.560
never give rewards,

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.520
I'm still gonna

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.200
grind them out

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.800
once he's back online.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.600
Really?

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.750
[Ten Days Later]

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.360
Morning, Mr. Lin.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:39.860
Morning.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:44.600
Mr. Lin,

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:45.360
you're back.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.020
Morning, Mr. Lin.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:46.620
Morning.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.880
And here come the "quests."

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:58.740
Yin Jie,

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.700
compile the review reports

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.220
from all departments

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.120
and bring them to my office.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:03.580
Will do.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.640
I'll just leave this with you then.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.060
Sure.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.540
Why does it feel like

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.520
I suddenly have nothing to do?

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.140
I'm dead meat.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.380
Once he's done seeing her out,

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.280
he's coming back to chew me out.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.300
I'm sure you've all heard
about the situation

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.240
regarding the former
Head of Procurement.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.840
The group

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.960
is conducting a detailed investigation,

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.260
so I won't be making
any definitive statements for now.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.300
However, I hope everyone,

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.840
including myself,

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.180
can take this as a warning.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:37.880
Next,

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.100
please join me in welcoming

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.080
the new additions

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:41.900
to our leadership team.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.080
Starting today, Ms. Chen

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.500
will serve

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.080
as the Head of Procurement.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.940
She has spent over a decade

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.520
in the PV industry

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.700
and is a true force to be reckoned with.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.820
I appreciate the kind words, Mr. Zhang.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.700
Let's stay in close touch.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.120
Mr. Ding

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.140
will take over
as the Head of Engineering.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:09.080
Wang Xin

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.380
will be the Deputy Head of Procurement.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.700
I look forward to

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.440
our journey ahead

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:20.860
as we drive Shuangyuan's growth together

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.920
for years to come.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:24.460
Now,

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.040
I'll turn the floor over to Mr. Lin

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.720
to walk us
through the financing updates.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.400
After several rounds of negotiation,

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.680
Yixin Trust

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.200
will issue

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.180
non-standard trust products

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:34.720
specifically to fund

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.780
Shuangyuan's capacity expansion

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.100
and the commercialization

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.200
of our PERC cell technology.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.940
The Phase II expansion project

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:45.980
has been stalled for some time now.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:47.740
The civil engineering contractors

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.580
and equipment suppliers

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.040
were all those handpicked
by Procurement.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.260
Mr. Ding,

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.240
you're new here,

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.080
so get up to speed
on this project as quickly as possible.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:54.960
Inspect

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.880
the civil works under construction

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:56.980
and the equipment delivered on-site.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:58.440
Then, get me

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.660
a detailed project progress schedule.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.140
Deal with the vendors and contractors.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.420
Fix them if you can.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.720
If not, bring in new ones.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:05.380
Understood.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.220
I'll get right on it.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.820
Since Mr. Mo got hauled off

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.659
by HQ,

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.639
we've had a total revolving door

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:15.679
of executives, haven't we?

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:19.020
It's only natural.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.219
A new boss

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:22.040
always wants

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.020
to bring in their own team.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.500
Yin Jie,

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.940
don't you think

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.780
Mr. Lin has barely

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:32.800
given me any work

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.639
since he's been back?

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:35.580
Really?

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.580
Totally!

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:38.280
I've been so bored

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.179
that I was reading gossip on my screen.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:40.800
Then one day,

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.219
he walked right past me

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.380
and I didn't even have time
to close the window,

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:44.380
and he saw it.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.340
I thought I was dead meat.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.139
But

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.219
he acted like he didn't see a thing.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.639
Nothing happened after that.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:52.880
Isn't that a good thing?

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.460
See?

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.040
All those document runs paid off.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.300
Your favorability

00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.700
is through the roof.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.280
Really?

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.740
But I feel like

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.000
he just can't be bothered
with me anymore,

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.640
like the favorability actually dropped.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.560
What now then?

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.220
Try harder?

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.700
No way.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.300
Who wouldn't love a life
without overtime?

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.140
I finally feel like

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.420
I'm actually living again.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.740
Let's go.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:37.960
Not at all.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.680
This was all thanks to
your invaluable help.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.280
If you ever need anything in the future,

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.440
just say the word
and I'll do whatever it takes.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:43.560
Okay.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:46.420
Alright.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:47.640
Sure.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.760
We should get together more often.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:49.680
Well then,

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.560
I'll let you get back to work.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:00.640
Zhuang Xu,

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.000
I've looked over

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.760
your report.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:03.560
What,

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.280
wasn't I clear enough about my position

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.240
the other day?

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.240
With the PV industry struggling,

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.960
it's only natural for you
to be cautious,

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.080
Mr. Song.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.160
Then why does your report

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.100
claim

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.580
that subsidies and policies

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.120
are gaining clarity,

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.400
and the outlook for new energy

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.580
is so bullish?

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.080
Why the obsession
with these positive indicators?

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.680
I also covered the U.S. AD/CVD,

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.920
and the EU's follow-up protectionism.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.340
The bullish and bearish factors

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.680
are all objective.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.400
Since you arranged for me

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.700
to do a site visit in Suzhou,

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.920
it was my duty to provide

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.040
a detailed, objective report

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.480
for your assessment.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.720
I didn't put much thought
into the "why".

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.120
I just followed your lead

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:40.800
to get the job done.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.160
Then you went to survey

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.880
a PV plant in Shanghai afterward?

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.120
Yes.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.400
I was short on time in Suzhou

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.600
and couldn't fit in

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.400
an on-site inspection.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.320
So I checked out a local company

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:51.960
in Shanghai instead.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.840
So young
but willing to put in the real work

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.400
without cutting corners.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.480
Well done.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.000
Zhuang Xu,

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.140
how long have you been with us?

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.080
Six months.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:18.940
Zhuang Xu.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.140
You've got good luck.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.280
It takes a team to succeed.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:26.720
The company needs it,

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.280
and so do I.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.280
How would you like

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.060
to join me in Investment Banking

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.520
and make a name for yourself?

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.650
[Drink Light]

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.900
Oh my goodness, Xu.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.540
Are you really moving
to Investment Banking?

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.940
I heard the pay is several times

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.340
higher than in Loans.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:37:59.580
It's about the same.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.040
Was it because of

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.060
that research report?

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.660
I should get some credit for that too.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:05.380
I really know my stuff,

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.120
even as a freshman.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.880
And countless reports before.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.380
You helped me find

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.020
a lot of data this time.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.260
You get the top credit.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.700
So, he's taking you
to Investment Banking

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.860
because you actually

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:18.580
put in the work

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.820
instead of trying to second-guess him

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.100
like everyone else?

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.800
Despite his casual attitude,

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:23.860
his requests

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.020
are firm mandates.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:27.980
I see.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.520
This isn't officially set yet,

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.220
so don't tell Mom.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.880
Not even

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:36.740
Mom or Rong?

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.360
Are you and Ye Rong

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:40.560
in touch that often?

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.380
Every now and then.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.700
She even sent me

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.620
a birthday gift.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:46.920
Didn't she tell you?

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.040
No.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:50.920
Xu,

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.020
don't you think

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.440
it's time you got a girlfriend?

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.860
It's a bit sad

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.960
that I'm the only one you have to share

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:57.980
such great news with.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:38:59.740
Wait, unless you...

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:00.680
Stop imagining things.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:08.840
Xu,

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.100
I feel like

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.480
you've changed a bit.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:14.660
Have I?

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:25.960
Too late.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.500
I should have changed sooner.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.020
What did you say?

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:34.300
I said it's late.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.220
Time to head home.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.040
I knew my weight gain
was all down to stress.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.020
Now that Mr. Lin is off my back,

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.280
the weight is just melting off.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.900
I've officially reverted
to my factory settings.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.880
Ever since I got that fridge,

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.060
I feel like I've actually put on weight.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:00.100
Procurement

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:00.980
just fired a bunch of people.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:01.960
How is there

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.300
still no vacancy in Building 1?

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.080
No clue.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.720
Maybe the people they let go

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.000
all live off-site.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.720
You in the dorm?

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.500
I'm coming over to do a load of laundry.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.220
Yeah,

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.140
come on over.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.880
Seriously?

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.960
You said you were in your room.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.000
I forgot my key,

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.640
so I tricked you into coming
so I'd have some company.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.200
Locked out again?

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.340
That's the second time

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.560
since you moved in.

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.160
Yuhua isn't here either?

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.040
She's in Kunshan visiting a classmate,

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:41.540
and who knows

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.400
when she'll be back.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.920
I went to Dorm Management

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.600
for the spare key,

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.460
but the office was empty.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.300
Just my luck.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.460
Is the balcony door unlocked?

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.660
It is,

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:53.940
but Xiguang,

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.340
don't tell me you're climbing again?

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.400
Don't. It's almost dark.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.440
It's too dangerous.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.740
Let's just wait until someone
from Dorm Management

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.400
shows up.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.040
Who knows how long that'll take?

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.240
What if Yuhua

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.400
doesn't come back tonight?

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.180
Whatever. It's not like
I haven't done this before.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.040
Hi.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.780
Mind if I use your balcony
to climb over?

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.340
Room 2212 is locked out again.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.960
Keep it down.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.040
Room 2212 is locked out again.

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:24.600
Thanks.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.460
Maybe we should wait a bit longer.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:27.440
It's too dangerous.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.760
It's okay.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.280
I grew up in the countryside.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.420
There's nothing I haven't climbed.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:32.400
Just be careful, okay?

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:32.800
Alright.

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:39.820
Who would've thought?

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.340
I made a special trip to Suzhou

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.280
just to drop off this invitation.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:44.460
And yet,

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.140
not only did I have to
track you down at the office,

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.720
you actually feed me at the cafeteria.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.920
Prove that it was a "special trip."

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:50.880
Besides,

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.560
who's the one rushing back to Shanghai

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.880
with no time for a proper meal?

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.180
