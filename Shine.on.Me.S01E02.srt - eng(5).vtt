00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.039
I graduated from Jiangning University,

with a major in accounting.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.320

I remember you were

against the expansion last year.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.420
That was in the first half of last year.

Back then, the global PV market

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.540

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.260
but signs of overcapacity

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.980
were already showing.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.040
So I thought

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.360
instead of expanding capacity,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.500
it would be better
to invest in technology,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.620

Now that the expansion
is already underway,

and the sunk costs are significant,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.520
we shouldn't hesitate.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.800
On the contrary,
we should speed things up,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.880
use the low points in the cycle

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.820

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.320

push Yuancheng

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.040

still isn't in place,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.360
we could consider a capital increase,

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.860
which would dilute their shares.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.940

It's fine.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.500
But from a purely business perspective,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.180
I don't see

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.220
anything that benefits Shengyuan.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.420
State your reasons.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.740
Wuxi does have strong potential,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.580
but the market lacks real momentum.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.320
And Wuxi's resettlement housing

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.200
is relatively high in quality,

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.700
which makes commercial housing

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.660
clear its inventory more slowly

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.680
than in other cities.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.400
That's a real disadvantage

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.600
for investors trying to recover funds.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.700
Of course,

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.520
Shengyuan can still profit from it.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.400
Just as Mr. Sheng Bokai

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.180
said before,

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.120
real estate

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.660
is full of golden opportunities.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.620
But some are big, and some are small.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.140
Whichever one you pick up

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.160
comes with a cost.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.660
And the piece Yuancheng tossed out

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.800
is just too small.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:29.860
Yuancheng

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.980
isn't short of big opportunities either.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.220
Just last year,

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:33.039
they made a big splash

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.039
by securing a plot in Nanjing.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.620
The expected profit

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.820
and cash recovery speed

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.919
far outstrip this project.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.419
Yet they kept it to themselves.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.100
Working long-term with a partner

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.500
that shows so little sincerity

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.260
is just a drain on energy

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.520
and brand influence,

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.520
while only fueling their own growth.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.580
What's with your nephew today?

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.560
He usually

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.120
keeps a low profile,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.240
but now he's suddenly so sharp.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.100
The Yuancheng project

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.320
is pretty much a nonstarter

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.160
for our group,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.560
but it doesn't really get

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.500
in Mr. Lin's way.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.320
I think there's something off about it.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.580
Go ask Mr. Nie

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.200
if he's got a problem

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.340
with Mr. Lin.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.460
I'll give

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.220

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.400

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.100
how he ended up pissing off my nephew.

Just talking about charity

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.280
and helping others grow

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.960
is enough

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.560
to make the Chairman hesitate.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.960

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.640

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.960
It's almost five.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.860
Exactly.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.860
At this hour,
it's gotta be a dinner gathering.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.460
Maybe she's got

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.240
an offer

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:51.720
from some big company

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:52.660
and wants to surprise us.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.780
Ximo Pavilion is close to the west gate.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.020
Could she be treating us
to that boiled fish

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.000
with pickled mustard greens
by the entrance?

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.080
Feng's going to be furious.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.140
She's been in Shanghai the past few days
meeting her advisor,

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.500
then went back home for a bit,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.220
and has already missed
several big dinners.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:08.940
Let's

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.740
give her a call tonight

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.400
and tell her how delicious it is,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.560
so she can feel included.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.520
It's not like she's not coming back.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.060
Careful. She might kill you
when she came back.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.220
Why'd you call everyone

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.260
to meet here?

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.360
Really for boiled fish
with pickled mustard greens?

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.580
Zhuang Xu, you're here, too.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:23.980
Where's Xiang Qun?

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.000
Why are you all staring at me like that?

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:38.900
Nie Xiguang.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.120
What?

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.680
You're really asking me that?

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.560
This is way too weird.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.960
After what you did,

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.740
don't you feel any guilt at all?

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.540
What did I do?

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:51.780
Rong,

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.360
chill.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.380
We haven't even got the full story yet.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.580
Xiguang,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.560
did you get a call

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:02.980
from Shengyuan

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.200
about the interview for Rong

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.400
on Monday afternoon?

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.940
Of course not.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.280
You still won't admit it?

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.140
Nie Xiguang,

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:11.480
I can't believe

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.380
you'd do something like this.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.420
Or maybe

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.240
she just forgot?

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.940
Xigua was still asleep

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.360
when we left that day.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.940
Maybe she picked it up

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.920
and went straight back to sleep,

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.140
and when she woke up,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.100
she just forgot to tell you.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.080
Are you suspecting me

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.640
of answering your interview call

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.880
and not telling you?

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.360
You must be mistaken.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.140
I never received

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.400
any interview calls for you.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.480
Why bother denying it?

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.740
Too bad your clever schemes backfired.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.960
If it hadn't been for Zhuang Xu

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.100
calling his senior

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.980
to ask,

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.580
you really might have

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.500
gotten away with it.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.280
Siliang,

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.400
can you walk us

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.560
through the whole thing?

00:16:58.140 --> 00:16:59.100
Rong never got

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.440
the interview call.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.200
So Zhuang Xu asked

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.780
his senior

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.160
who works in HR at Shengyuan.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.700
She said they sent out

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:08.660
a unified notice

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.780
right after work started
on Monday afternoon,

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.859
and Rong was on the interview list.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.540
Since her phone was stolen,

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.440
the company

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.900
could only call our dorm.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.099
That afternoon,

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.740
Rong, Fen,

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.020
Feng and I

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.460
went out together.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.460
You were the only one
sleeping in the dorm.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.839
Boss went out of town for an interview

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.460
and came back Tuesday.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.880
I was with Rong and Fen

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.100
all afternoon.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.760
Feng went to the train station.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:32.980
So

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.400
think carefully.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.620
Did you take the call back then

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:38.760
and just forget?

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.860
I'm absolutely certain I didn't.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.960
Actually, not long after you all left,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.020
I went straight to the library.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:44.940
So I never received

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.620
any call at all.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.340
You're really washing your hands of it.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.220
Maybe Shengyuan

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.440
never even called.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.920
Or maybe they missed it,

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.400
or dialed but no one picked up,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.580
and then forgot

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.700
to call again.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.420
I knew you'd say that.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.260
Luckily, his senior

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.160
went the extra mile

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.700
and asked the person
in charge of notifications.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.360
The staff, afraid of being accused,

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.300
pulled up the call records.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.880
It was made at 2:30 PM,

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.920
and lasted almost a minute.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:22.800
He said

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.100
the person who answered promised

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.320
to pass the message along,

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.820
so they didn't

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.720
call again.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.640
But who could have imagined

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.360
you could be so malicious?

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.120
No matter what they say,

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.200
the fact is I never got

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.160
any calls.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.100
Besides,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.000
why would I do that?

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:44.920
No reason?

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.920
Don't you like Zhuang Xu?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.020
Shengyuan is so close to Huaya.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.140
You don't want me and Zhuang Xu

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:50.720
to be together, do you?

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:51.140
That's why you...

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:51.480
Rong.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.700
Maybe it really is
just a misunderstanding.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.200
Anyway, you've got

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.400
another interview now.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.040
Let it go.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.920
Don't make everyone

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:01.420
upset.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.280
Yeah.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.000
I feel like something

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.240
went wrong in all this.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.560
The matter can be left behind.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.800
But look at her.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.900
Has she shown

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.440
even a hint of regret

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.640
or the slightest apology?

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.980
I just can't swallow it.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.620
Ye Rong,

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.240
you're seriously underestimating me.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.240
If I really wanted to stop you

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.180
from getting the interview,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.440
do you think Shengyuan

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.680
would've called you at all?

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.300
Who do you think you are?

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.680
Nowadays,

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.720
it's all about strength.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.260
Wanna give it a try?

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:09.840
Hello?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.660
Is this Manager Li?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.860
This is Nie Xiguang.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:14.900
Sorry.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.200
Sorry...

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:15.620
We're from...

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.760
The number you dialed does not exist.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.520
Please check it and redial.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:20.960
Sorry,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.620
the number you dialed does not exist.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.740
Please check it and redial.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.520
It's an invalid number.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.100
I really thought

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.300
money could work miracles,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.380
but it was all just for show.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.540
I'll say it one more time.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.440
I never did it.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.060
Believe me or not.

Did you move back

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.260
because of Zhuang Xu?

Rong doesn't have a boyfriend,

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.660
I know that.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.940
So what exactly

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.560
is her relationship with Zhuang Xu?

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.380
If they like each other,

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.680
then I'll give up.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.540
I'm not sure about that.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.060
Why don't you

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.060
Recently, you may have heard

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.640
my dorm mate, Ye Rong,

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.700
missed her interview

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.500
with Shanghai Shengyuan
because she lost her phone.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.300
There's been talk

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.140
that when Shengyuan called our dorm,

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.500
Nie Xiguang

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.260
answered,

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.320
but didn't pass on the message,

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.700
which led to her missing it.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.740
I need to make a correction.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.600
I was the one who answered that call.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:55.680
It was her?

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.060
It was last Monday afternoon.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.040
I went out with Rong, Siliang

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.280
and Fen.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.800
They had errands to run,

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.840
and I went to Shanghai.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.500
When I got to the train station,

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.220
I realized I'd forgotten my ID card,

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.740
so I went back to the dorm to get it.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.180
Since I was in a hurry,

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.340
I took a taxi.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.840
I kept the receipt

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.020
in my wallet.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:15.920
Shengyuan's call

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:16.860
came at 2:30 PM.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:17.880
By a little after 2:40 PM,

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.940
I got in the taxi at the north gate.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.200
You can check the timing.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.020
It's true.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.580
If this isn't enough,

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.540
I've got more evidence.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:33.960
The traffic jam made me late.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.240
Here's your gift for making it ashore.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:35.880
Thank you.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.460
That day,

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.420
after Fen and Feng left,

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:40.640
I got up soon after

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.440
and went to the library.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.740
When I arrived,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.380
I first returned the book I'd borrowed.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.140
So the library

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.720
has my return record and timestamp.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.060
I took a photo of it.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.140
The system is right there.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.020
Anyone can check it anytime.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.860
If you still don't believe me,

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.640
the dorm office and library

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.460
have surveillance footage.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.060
I'm just a student,

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.080
so I can't check it myself.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.540
If necessary, we can request it
through the school,

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.040
and I'm sure it can be reviewed.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.400
No need.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.360
I trust you.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.800
Now it seems

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.920
this was all a misunderstanding.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.300
It wasn't Nie Xiguang

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.560
but Feng, who forgot to tell Ye Rong.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.800
This is the second thing

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.500
I want to clear up.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.080
I didn't forget.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.960
I remember very clearly

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.840
that the staff at Shengyuan told me

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.180
they would notify Rong later.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.740
But I don't know why,

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.160
when Rong and Zhuang Xu called them,

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.440
they suddenly changed their story.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:30.720
And

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:31.840
I have no way

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.500
to prove this part.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.060
I can.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.460
I went to an interview at Shengyuan,

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.400
so I have the phone number

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.620
of their HR manager.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:42.640
Of course,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.240
not the senior

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.220
Rong and Zhuang Xu

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.660
spoke to on the phone.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.640
I asked the HR manager

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.380
to help me investigate.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.160
He was very helpful,

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.220
and after looking into it, he told me

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.680
that the staff

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.920
in charge of interview notices

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.800
forgot to notify Ye Rong
the second time.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.160
But when the senior asked about it,

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.080
that employee was afraid
of taking responsibility

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:01.940
and lied.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.360
Here is the recording

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.200
of my conversation with Mr. Li,

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.520
along with the employee's apology.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:07.880
I recorded it

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:08.780
with their consent.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.020
Xigua,

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.100
I'm touched by how much
you've done for me.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:21.900
You stood up bravely

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.280
for my innocence,

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:24.860
so of course

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.940
I'll fight for yours too.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:32.800
And one more thing,

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.600
I want to make it clear.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.179
After all that's happened,

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.980
I find Shengyuan completely unreliable,

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:40.159
and utterly undeserving of me.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.239
So I've decided

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.659
I won't be joining them.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:09.680
Xiguang.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:13.960
I'm sorry

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.380
for not saying anything that day

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.260
to defend you.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.860
I owe you an apology.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.660
Me too, Xiguang.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.740
I really thought you had just forgotten.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.400
It's fine.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.060
My head

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.680
was all foggy that day.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.960
Can't blame you for that.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.580
But Boss.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.760
Why did you suddenly...

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.860
start clapping during dinner?

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.080
It was so awkward.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.340
I almost couldn't breathe.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.720
I have no idea.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.340
You were really...

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.020
I don't know how to describe it.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.920
After four years as classmates,

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.340
I always thought you were

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.220
laid-back, a "go-with-the-flow" type.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.080
Never imagined

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.140
you'd be like this.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.840
You were absolutely dazzling, seriously.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.320
You practically stole the whole show!

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.420
This really isn't Boss's fault.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.140
I was stunned too.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.660
This just shows

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.380
you don't really know me.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:12.960
In the crunch,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.080
I can

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.140
own the spotlight.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.660
[Chang:]
Here they come.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.460
[Heard the drama just flipped around?]
The gossip's already started.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.720
[Nie Xiguang didn't hide
Ye Rong's interview call.]

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.400
[Xue: So what really happened?]

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.860
I especially asked a few

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.460
[Xin: Poor Nie Xiguang]
of our top gossipers to dinner.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.040
[being wrongly accused for so long.]

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:31.700
Tomorrow,

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.320
no,

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.580
not tomorrow,

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.240
tonight,

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.180
everyone in the Business School
will know

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.300
that Xigua was wronged.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.840
Well, then the treat wasn't in vain.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.320
Why didn't you let me pay?

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.540
Come on.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.420
I got into grad school.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:47.700
Of course I had to treat.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.400
I just invited a few extra folks

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.060
as messengers.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.300
There's no way I'd make you pay.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.740
You've had enough bad luck already.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.260
Making you chip in?

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:55.980
That's just not fair.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:58.940
By the way, Feng,

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.120
didn't you invite Rong and Siliang?

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.700
Of course I did.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.780
How could I not?

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.100
Siliang couldn't make it.
Something came up.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.520
As for Rong...

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.480
I told her

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.380
that this dinner

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.000
was meant to clear up
the misunderstanding.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.280
She chose not to come.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.500
Honestly,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.420
I didn't think this needed

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.360
to be made

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.720
such a big deal.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.340
But after I explained it

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:25.300
to a few classmates,

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.540
within a couple of days,
people started saying

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.280
I was brown-nosing Xigua

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.280
and taking the blame for her.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.020
I was furious!

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:33.760
Isn't that an insult

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.740
to my character?

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.140
Really?

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.460
Seriously, that's ridiculous.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.400
Luckily, it's all cleared up now,

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.680
otherwise I'd still be stewing over it.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.560
Just one month left,

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.720
and we'll be graduating.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.420
Pulling something like this
right before graduation

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.000
is way too awkward.

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.340
What's so awkward about it?

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.680
The real embarrassment is on those

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.800
who spread rumors

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.140
and refuse to listen to any explanation.

Xigua,

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:58.680
for the next couple of days,

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.440
maybe you can try

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.200
putting on

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.760
that "poor me,

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.460
life's so unfair" look?

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.200
I don't even need to put it on.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.120
I already look miserable.

What's wrong?

My thesis.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:14.120
I turned in my first draft
a few days ago.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.120
When I was

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:15.920
buying you that cake,

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:16.960

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.320
This doesn't sound good.

give you a scare,

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.000
like, "delayed graduation,"

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:27.760
or "not good enough."

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.320
Just tough it out and you'll be fine.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.060
Yeah,

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.180
you will make it.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.560
Honestly, you guys

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.340
make me even more nervous.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.840

I owe you an apology.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.960
I didn't expect the staff

Thanks for telling me, senior.

You have some, too.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:16.280
Okay.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.520
If your father

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.920
could see

how well you've done,

Thanks for all these years.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.180
a real sense of achievement.

Now you've graduated from college,

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.020

you should make it official
with Rong ASAP.

Just let me finish.

As the saying goes,

About that interview,

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.160
you got Rong a phone

I'm not saying it's outright wrong.

a real favor
