[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.830
[Episode 27]

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.700
How old is your child?

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.960
Is he in kindergarten?

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.090
Your child.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.860
When you came back to China,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.720
did your child come back with you?

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.930
Did Jin Zhao tell you about this?

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.729
He mentioned it at a dinner once.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.970
Does he

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.530
talk about me often?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.570
He doesn't talk much
about his personal life,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:18.630
but everyone knows

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.180
Mr. Jin's wife lives abroad
with their child.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.500
He said his child is quite lazy,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.700
and likes to sleep in.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.810
That's such an easy child to take care of!

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.780
My sister's kid

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.620
wakes up at five every morning.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.980
That's a real headache.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.180
The adults can't get any sleep, either.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.250
But my sister's daughter
has the same issue as yours—

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.380
she's a picky eater.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.780
Won't eat this, won't eat that.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.980
It's so frustrating.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.090
My aunt said it's because
of poor spleen function.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.220
She took her for therapeutic massage.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.900
You could try that, too.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.829
You're the one with poor spleen function.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.850
Wife? Child?

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.050
You've made up quite a story.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.690
According to you,
I'm both a mother and a daughter—

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.150
playing two roles at once.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.970
What exactly have you been telling people?

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.570
Now your lazy, picky little baby

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.340
is angry.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500
Don't you need to explain yourself?

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.650
I'm busy.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.690
Later.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.420
Why did you come back?

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.940
I heard there was a child who was upset.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.810
I'm here to comfort her.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.420
Is this how you comfort someone?

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.090
How would you like me to comfort you, then?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.690
You've really changed now.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.860
You weren't like this before.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.120
You used to pull me into alleys
and tell me

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.370
that girls shouldn't behave this way.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.540
Back then,
you were still immature.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.270
Don't give me that parent talk.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.860
Look at the axis.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.420
From here to here, it's 30.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.180
Does it matter if it exceeds 30?

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.780
Thank you, Senior.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.740
Here, try it.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.020
I waited in line to buy you this coffee.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.210
Their coffee is award-winning.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.659
I queued up at 4 or 5 a.m.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.020
I queued for a long time.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.010
Why did you only buy one for him?

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.740
I don't get one?

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.860
So what?

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:40.980
-You are so biased—
-Here.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.840
You can have it.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.180
Senior, you're too nice.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.330
He likes me.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.370
We are close, right?

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.210
Senior.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.500
Is there something wrong

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.300
with this diagram's wheelbase?

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.130
Don't you know this?
It was taught in class.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.790
Let me do it.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.690
It's so easy.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.770
Don't you know?

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.180
Tell him. Yes, tell him.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.860
Look at this point and this point.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.250
Yes.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.010
That one.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.030
-Let me tell you.
-The blackboard.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.780
Mu!

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.250
Why are you here?

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.170
Without telling me, either.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.210
I'm here to tell you that

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.740
I've received the notice of employment.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.620
From today onwards,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.130
I'm a full-time employee
of the research institute.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.390
Notice of employment?

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.740
Show me.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.830
No.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.100
Not unless you hug me.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.280
Don't you see where we are?

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.190
What? Does your school

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.100
have rules against dating?

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.700
You're acting strange.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.100
What's strange about me?

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.210
I'm wondering when

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.370
you'll buy me a coffee, too.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.010
Zhao, is this your girlfriend?

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.270
Never seen her before.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:01.450
Yes.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.180
She's usually quite busy.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.010
She finally found some time

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.670
to grace me with her presence.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.960
Alright, we're heading out first, then.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.160
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.340
Does that short-haired girl like you?

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.920
Why did she only buy coffee for you

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.250
and not for anyone else?

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.690
They came to discuss

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.250
fluid mechanics with me

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.570
and to ask about admissions.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.330
I run a coffee shop myself.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.090
Isn't the coffee at home good enough?

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.150
Why bother drinking someone else's?

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.520
Behave yourself.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.010
Don't you see where we are?

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.380
Our school doesn't have rules
against dating.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.630
Am I coming to dinner tonight, too?

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.300
With whom?

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.120
You'll find out when you get there.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.260
Who is it?

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.550
What's the rush?

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.430
Come here!

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.570
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.300
Look.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.540
My angle is so tight here.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.960
And then you parked your car sideways.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.490
How am I supposed to back up?

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.520
I'll go handle this.
You go up and wait for me.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.170
Hey, Ma'am, I...

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.430
What do you mean "hey"?

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.060
I know that look on your face.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.600
Are you discriminating against
female drivers?

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.660
Let me tell you, I can sue you for this.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.380
It's him who blocked this spot,

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.510
making it impossible for me to back up.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.080
Why are you honking?

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.140
It's because he parked sideways here—

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.720
let me tell you.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.790
Come and judge for yourself.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.190
Wen, move your car first.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.870
I'll help you back up.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.380
Alright.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.180
Sanlai!

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.970
Jiang Mu?

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.350
What are you doing here?

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.190
Oh my God!

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.810
Long time no see.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.260
Long time no see.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.660
Our Jiang Mu

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.660
is getting more and more beautiful.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.850
Just good makeup.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:10.950
Where's Brandy?

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.710
He went to park the car.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.540
Park?

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.040
He can handle the steering wheel now?

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:19.710
That's good.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.160
Anyway, now that you're here with him,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.090
encourage him to drive more often.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.600
Who are you chatting with?

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.720
Oh my God! Isn't this my lil' sis?

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.020
Crazy?

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.850
You've really grown up!

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.050
You've become so pretty!

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.370
-I almost didn't recognize you.
-Take it easy.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.730
You've changed a lot, too.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.610
More mature, right?

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.010
More weathered, I'd say.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.710
What are you talking about?

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.530
When did you two get in touch?

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:44.790
Why didn't you tell us?

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.170
It's been a while.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.000
Don't just stand there.
Let's sit down and talk.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.600
Okay.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.570
How long has it been since we last met?

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.260
Today, I've got to drink with Mu.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:56.970
Yes.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.310
She won't be drinking.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:00.970
It made sense
when you protected her at 18.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:01.900
But you're still doing it now.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.900
Won't you let us get a little closer?

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.250
I'm in a good mood today.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.510
If Mu doesn't drink, the three of us will.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.440
I'm not drinking, either.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.540
Just the two of us, then.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.470
Waiter!

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.850
Bring the food!

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.790
After what happened to Brandy,

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.710
I completely cut ties with Wan's.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:22.860
But anyway,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.970
Crazy handled this matter properly.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.570
This shows that in his heart,

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.300
he still cares about us.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.450
Can you stop being so sappy?

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.060
I just felt guilty.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.240
I was careless with what happened

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.120
with Iron Cock,

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.010
hurting Brandy.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.140
It's okay.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.380
Being alive is what matters.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.900
He suffered for a few years.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.160
But thankfully
Crazy was there at the time.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.130
He's big enough

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.710
and helped me take care of Brandy,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:53.970
making things easier.

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.550
I barely took care of him for a few days.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.920
As soon as he felt a little better,
he wanted to take the self-study exam,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.250
dragging me along, too.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.210
Come on, you have the nerve to complain?

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:02.960
Do you know why he took you with him?

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.800
He was sick

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.330
and you were making all that noise
playing video games.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.410
It was bothering him.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.670
I've never liked studying
since I was a kid.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.970
After middle school,
I just became a slacker.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.420
Absolutely ungrateful.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.490
If it weren't for Brandy,

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.490
would you be a college graduate now?

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.520
Brandy originally wanted to drag him along
to take the graduate exam.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.790
This guy threatened to kill himself,

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.300
so Brandy finally let him off the hook.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.060
Look, at my age,

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.570
I'm satisfied

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.570
just getting a college degree.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.230
You really should be content.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.810
Crazy is doing well now.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.520
He's working as a technician under Brandy.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.320
His life has some stability now.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.040
However, he still hasn't found

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.420
a partner...

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.050
Jiang Mu,

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.500
help Crazy find someone good.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.690
Mu, I'm counting on you for this.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.420
These two aren't reliable.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:49.680
No problem. Leave it to me.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.240
Sanlai, don't just talk about Crazy Jin.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.170
Tell us about yourself.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.370
How have you been doing all these years?

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.380
Just by looking at me

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.180
you can tell I'm doing very well.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:05.570
However,

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.660
when Brandy left back then,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.760
Xishi died, too.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.140
I was quite heartbroken.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:10.970
So I thought

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.610
I'd close down the pet shop.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:14.500
Later I opened a fast food restaurant.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.530
Business is still pretty good, though.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.660
So that fast food restaurant is yours?

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.200
You've been there?

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.180
I didn't go in.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.610
I saw it when I returned
during my first vacation

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.010
when I studied in Canada.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:37.930
You know what?

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.060
I'm truly a business genius.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.450
When I opened that fast food restaurant,

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.060
I made quite a bit of money
after a few years.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.260
But later I realized
without my bros around me,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.520
life was really tough.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.210
So I leased out the restaurant

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.570
and came back to join Brandy.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:50.490
This guy

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.530
rushed back here in such a hurry.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.060
He opened a fast food restaurant
right at the factory entrance.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.890
When he first opened,
there was no business at all.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.560
If it weren't for all of us

00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.610
supporting him,

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.010
I tell you,
he would've gone under long ago.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.610
Plus, Brandy

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.099
had some influence.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.380
More and more people

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:07.730
started eating at his place

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.970
instead of the cafeteria.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.819
He even borrowed my savings.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.010
Saying he wanted to expand the business.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.720
Made it so our cafeteria
couldn't even stay in business.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.859
Our boss had a real problem with him.

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:17.099
That's enough.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.800
Are you getting old?

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:20.710
Why are you so talkative?

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.099
Who borrowed money from you?

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:23.300
Don't talk nonsense.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.490
Let me summarize.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.099
So this factory

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.010
wanted to change their cafeteria operator.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.920
So I submitted a bid.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.010
Surprisingly, many of the managers

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:31.490
had eaten at my restaurant before

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.290
and gave me the opportunity,

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.290
and they chose me.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.420
Give me a break.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.890
It's thanks to that glib tongue of yours

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.450
that you secured the contract.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.340
That's enough.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.150
Speaking of which, I just remembered.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.770
Are you tired? Would you like some water?

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:43.420
Well.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.710
Let me formally introduce myself again.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.770
I'm now

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.970
a man with a business card.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.370
I'm a Cafeteria Manager.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:55.550
All right.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.580
So you're

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.780
planning to stay in Nanjing from now on?

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.120
Yeah, just like you.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.010
Clinging onto Brandy.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.250
I can see that.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.990
You do that yourself.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.820
-Why is it your name on this?
-I won't cling onto him.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.820
You only have Brandy.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.610
-You don't even have a partner.
-I didn't write it.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.400
You really know how to hit a sore spot,
don't you?

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.810
What about it?

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.820
-You, too.
-Stop talking.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.420
Come on, have a drink.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.210
Come on.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.140
I'll just drink water for now
and make it up next time.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:21.690
Fine, you owe us one.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.690
-When will you make it up?
-I owe you.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.520
We've been apart for so long.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.800
Yet in this reunion,

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.050
we're still as close as before.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.370
It's like time hasn't passed at all.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.380
Sanlai is still as eloquent as before,

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.290
talking non-stop.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.970
And there's still the jumpy Crazy,

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.900
who loves to bicker with Sanlai.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.560
It's just that

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.580
Sanlai has become more composed
than before.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.960
And Crazy's hair has gone from red

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.270
to black.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.300
When Zhao is with them,

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.170
though he doesn't say much,

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:01.410
you can tell

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.320
he's at peace and is content.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.180
Perhaps now,

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.370
few people know about his tumultuous past.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.920
Only in front of these old friends,

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.330
he's still the same Brandy.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:18.960
I quit.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:21.440
You quit?

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.920
You're not trying to have a baby, are you?

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.180
Are you really planning to wait

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.480
until your kid is grown up
and running around

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.540
before telling us?

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.410
It hasn't been that long,

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.190
just

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.920
a little over two months.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.090
Brandy! Look at you.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.660
It's not like we never met

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.140
or had meals together during these two months.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:47.770
Your mouth seems

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.500
like it's been padlocked shut.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.630
Don't act like an old nanny.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.010
I can't be giving you

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.670
every single life update by calling you,
right?

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.650
That day I called you
during Mid-Autumn Festival,

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.680
that girl on the phone was Jiang Mu,
right?

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.590
You two were already together then?

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.980
Not yet at that time.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.490
Fine!

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:12.770
No wonder lately

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.570
I could never get you to hang out.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.450
Every time we met,

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.530
you acted like you had firecrackers
under your butt—

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:18.730
barely sitting down before leaving.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.130
So you were rushing back
to be with Jiang Mu.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.990
It's the honeymoon phase.

00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:35.355
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.900
Yeah, right!

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.010
What kind of honeymoon phase
lasts for so many years?

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.410
Isn't that nice, though?

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.850
Zhao and Mu.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.770
Tell me,

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.170
how far have you two gone?

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.030
I want to marry her.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.250
Jin and I were

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.620
discussing this the other day—

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.380
saying if either of us got married,

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.280
you'd be left alone.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.680
We were just thinking
how pitiful you'd be.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.340
And now you're telling me

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.820
you want to get married?

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.600
Put your hand down.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.850
Back then,
when you changed your number,

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.050
why did you persuade me
to change mine too,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.980
not letting me contact Jiang Mu?

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.050
That was because at that time...

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:14.660
You haven't been

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.770
guarding against me all these years,
have you?

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.070
You knew how handsome and charming I am,

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.210
and you were afraid Jiang Mu

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.600
might fall for me
if she contacted me too much.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.250
Right?

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.150
Yes.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.010
I was just jealous of you.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.440
I get jealous of any man

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.670
who appears around Mu.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:37.530
You're just love-obsessed.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.490
I am love-obsessed.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.290
You're no fun.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:43.950
Wait a second.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.630
If you get married, do I have to

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.180
give two wedding gifts?

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.860
Two, three, four, five gifts are all fine.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.590
Be generous.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.500
Something up at the company?

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:00.520
Okay, I'll head back first.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.920
During the first two years
I was studying in Canada,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.380
I returned to Manshi
every vacation to look for you.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.440
But what about you?

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:13.690
Not a word from you.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.340
I was so angry.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.020
I swore I would never go back
to find you again.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:20.690
Here, don't be angry.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.450
But who knew?

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.880
In the third and fourth year,
I still couldn't resist.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:33.660
Do you know

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.530
which time
left the deepest impression

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:36.690
on me?

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:40.530
Once at the airport,

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.490
I lost my laptop bag.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.050
It wasn't the laptop that mattered,

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.910
but the keychain
you gave me that was attached to it.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.690
I searched frantically everywhere,

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:51.940
but couldn't find it anywhere.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.250
I was almost in tears.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.380
Fortunately, in the end,

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.910
a cleaning lady found it
and returned it to me.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.370
Thank goodness it was found.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.080
I'm glad you found it.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:19.790
It was my fault.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.900
I made you suffer.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.050
So you do know I suffered.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.010
How do you plan to make it up to me?

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.100
How would you like me
to make it up to you?

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.810
What are you guys doing?

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.040
Would you like some red wine?

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.840
No, thanks.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.930
The airplane food was terrible.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:22.130
I'm starving.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.240
Here.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:29.150
Egg fried rice.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.260
His fried rice is amazing.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.520
Aren't you having any?

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:33.810
You go ahead.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.290
What a shame.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.170
No one loves egg fried rice
as much as you do.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.580
Mind your own business.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.690
I won't stay long this time.

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.740
I won't intrude
on your private time together.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.670
It's your place.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.060
Do as you please.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.370
His place?

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.730
To be precise,

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.350
it's a company apartment.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.770
But occasionally when I'm here
on business, I stay here

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:05.580
and annoy him.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.100
Annoying indeed.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.300
Then don't stay here.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:10.570
Then stop eating.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:12.630
Let him finish eating.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:15.860
Sit down.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.580
He came to Nanjing

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.700
even before his injury had healed.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.000
No one could stop him.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.350
I didn't know why back then,

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:27.490
but now...

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.730
I think I understand.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.180
If it weren't for me,

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:35.970
you would have lost that leg.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.370
You can have it back.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:42.140
You know

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.920
that's not what I want.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.180
There are things I have to do.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.570
It would trouble me otherwise.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.520
That's why I had to return to Nanjing.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.560
Jin Zhao.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.120
Will you...

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.690
ever drive again?

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.720
How have you been lately?

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.140
Are you feeling better?

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:25.870
Much better.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.180
I even walked for half an hour yesterday.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.550
You owe me a big favor.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:34.970
How should I repay it?

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.440
I haven't decided yet.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.420
What I wanted most was

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.660
to have one good race against you.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:45.450
But

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.860
with your current physical condition,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.960
honestly,

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.290
I think

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.550
you're pretty much done with racing.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.220
Thank you for your honesty.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.680
So,

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.250
what are you planning to do next?

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.690
I'm not sure yet.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.660
I definitely can't just do nothing.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.260
Since I can't race anymore, maybe...

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.850
I'll finish my studies.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.680
I'll go study cars.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.210
Interesting idea.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.610
Mu

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.610
has always wanted me
to finish my studies, too.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:27.640
Jiang Mu?

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.110
You haven't been in touch with her,
have you?

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:37.570
Like you said,

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.130
my body will never be the same again.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.280
Mu should find someone...

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.150
healthier

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:47.330
to spend her life with.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.420
I think

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.430
you're making decisions for her.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:58.100
However,

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.400
I still respect your choice.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.780
My club needs someone in a core position.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.620
I now believe

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.190
the most important quality
for that position

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.320
isn't necessarily speed on the track.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.110
My club

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.640
is still open to you.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.340
You're welcome to join

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:22.970
anytime.

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.920
We'll see.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.290
I gave him a condition at that time.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.750
What condition?

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.290
I invested in a

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:37.940
racing club.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.130
Asked him to mentor
the young people in the club,

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:43.230
and share his experience with them.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.430
No wonder you often go on business trips.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.820
He's a partner

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:52.660
at the club.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:57.620
An exploited partner.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.860
You have no idea how long I begged him

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.390
before he agreed to help me.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.440
Enough.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.970
What are you really here for today?

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.410
Jin Zhao, do you want to

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.640
return to the team and drive for me?

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:29.970
I've asked Dr. Julia.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.620
She said your body has recovered now,

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.370
so you can try driving again.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.030
As long as

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.260
you overcome your psychological barriers.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.170
Taking compromising photos of me?

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.100
Now I have leverage over you.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.770
For the next few questions I ask,

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:27.780
you'd better answer honestly.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.580
What do you want to know?

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.030
Hearing from Sanlai and Crazy Jin today,

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.420
I'm very curious about
what you've been doing these 6 years.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.880
I spent a few years abroad,

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.340
then came back to China.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.580
When you were abroad,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.130
who were you with?

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.140
Sanlai

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.480
and Crazy Jin.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.620
Who else?

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.210
Tell me the truth.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.450
Did Sanlai

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.580
contact you?

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.840
Yes, I had some free time today

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.680
and caught up with Sanlai.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.110
I just spent a few years abroad.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.110
The medical technology there is better.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.710
I came back after treatment.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.610
Answer me properly. With whom?

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:20.860
No one.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.110
Look at you, hesitating to speak.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.500
You don't have another woman, do you?

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.050
No.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:28.340
Look.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:29.900
You didn't deny it right away.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:30.820
You hesitated.

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.930
You're not answering me.
You're not being honest.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.410
I'm up.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.640
Where is he?

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:57.730
Where did he go?

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:08.730
[We're out to buy breakfast. Wait for me.]

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:43.340
Don't block the way!

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.510
Why are you blocking? So annoying.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.610
Sorry.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.690
Save me a spot!

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.410
Are you always this crazy

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.050
when grocery shopping?

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.910
It's not usually like this.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:10.490
Are you done?

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:14.230
This one

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:15.400
looks good.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:18.490
Not fresh enough.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:24.270
The potatoes are good.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.340
Green pepper and
shredded potatoes would work.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.230
Shredded potatoes are fine,

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:29.180
but not green peppers.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.910
Mu doesn't like green peppers.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:34.350
Ma'am, please weigh these.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:34.980
Here.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:38.990
-Pork ribs.
-2.80 yuan.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.360
You're buying more?

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.490
Young man, 2.80.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.060
Okay.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.200
Sir, please weigh these ribs.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.050
Sure.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.350
Is the meat fresh?

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.400
Very fresh.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:54.430
How much longer will we be?

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:55.050
Almost done.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.210
Weren't you the one
who wanted to come along?

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:59.210
But I didn't expect this situation.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.930
Wait a moment. One last thing.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.710
Farm eggs.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.580
Farm eggs?

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.710
-Sir, you haven't paid!
-What is that?

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:07.770
Pay up.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.780
Pay over there with the QR code.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:10.650
Okay.

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:30.810
Weigh these.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.440
Okay.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:36.790
Potatoes, eggs.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:38.219
Got them.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:39.179
Ribs.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:40.460
Got it.

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.739
Cabbage, eggplant, cilantro.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.699
Got them.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.610
Edamame, cucumber.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.090
Got them.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:50.820
Green onions, lettuce, oranges, bananas.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:51.570
Got everything?

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:52.420
Yes.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.300
What are you smiling at?

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.550
You're acting strange.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.790
How am I acting strange?

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.190
You're not planning

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:08.980
to marry Mu, are you?

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.100
[Epilogue]

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:16.780
Excuse me.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:18.180
Have you seen

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:18.890
a keychain?

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.220
-How does it look like?
-I really need help to find it.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.770
It's... It's about this big.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.900
-With four Chinese characters on it.
-Oh, okay.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:24.740
Please, you have to help me.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.130
-It's really important.
-Okay, I got it.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:28.090
I'm begging you.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:28.780
Please find it.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.260
A passenger has lost an item.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.780
It's a keychain

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.260
with four Chinese characters on it.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:47.850
Excuse me.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.630
Yes, sir.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.260
I found a keychain.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:55.960
It belongs to that girl.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.120
Could you please give it to her?

00:35:58.410 --> 00:35:59.510
-There are four Chinese words on it.
-Okay.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.110
Thank you.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.540
It's made of leather.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.090
It says "Zhao and Mu" on it.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.430
If anyone finds it,

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:06.120
please return it to the service desk.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:06.850
Hello.

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:09.290
Is it this one?

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.780
Yes, that's it.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.570
Thank you.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.290
You're welcome.

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:15.960
This is it.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:16.550
Okay.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.900
