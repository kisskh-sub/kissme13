[Episode 25]

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.590
[Macau - Hong Kong]

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.920
Who's there?

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.890
It's from the inner harbor pier.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.860
Something's up. Assemble quickly!

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.790
Fire!

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.430
Get on the ship!

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.960
Let's go!

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.990
Follow me to the roof!

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:19.750
Go!

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.980
Mr. Huang,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.540
we've captured all the crew members.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.340
Lock them all in the bottom hold.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.810
Tell our men to hurry up.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.740
Start the engine and raise anchor!

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.630
Freeze!

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.800
Nobody move!

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:46.930
Ah!

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.710
Inspector General Gonçalves!

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.280
You arrived at the right time!

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.380
A group of bandits
just hijacked this ship.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.630
I, Agency Chief Sawa, acted bravely

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.530
and opened fire on the perpetrators.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.370
With so many police officers injured,

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.800
you call this fighting perpetrators?

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.280
Absolute nonsense!

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.770
Believe it or not.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:10.950
It's getting late.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.750
I've got to go.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.310
Stop! Don't move!

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.710
Alas...

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.250
Inspector General Gonçalves,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.690
you seem to have forgotten something.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.030
My official position is

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.400
the military attaché
at the Japanese Consulate in Macau.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.880
I have official diplomatic status

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.560
and diplomatic immunity.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.930
Thank you for your hard work!

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.120
♪City of joy♪

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.860
♪City of love♪

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.630
None of our calls is getting through.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.330
Check each body carefully

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.850
to confirm if there are any signs of life.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.680
Once you spot any,
begin resuscitation immediately.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.560
Prepare extra plasma, gauze,
and hemostats.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.000
If we're short-staffed, call immediately

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.159
and have the hospital send more staff.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.680
Remember, you must check each body.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.390
Dr. Ke.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:50.420
Dr. Ke,

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.730
what happened?

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:56.060
You may ask them.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.380
Mr. Rodrigues,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.380
Mr. Lok Pak,

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.510
where is the Steamship Sai On?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.080
So you still

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.430
carried out the SS Sai On Plan.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.070
How can you still have an appetite
at a time like this?

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.270
After a night of hustle,

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.820
I can handle this much food.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.540
Sawa!

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.090
Do you even know

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.520
how much trouble
you've stirred up tonight?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.450
Armed hijacking of the ship,

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:50.100
bombing the telephone exchange,

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.000
and even

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.490
shooting Portuguese police officers
with machine guns.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.900
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.620
What am I trying to do?

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.040
Obviously,

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.730
I want to grab the Steamship Sai On.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.310
If you wanted SS Sai On,

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.570
you could have just handed it to the Navy.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.460
Was it really necessary to resort to force

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.940
and create such a bloody scene?

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.630
Man...

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.400
Listen carefully.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.600
If we let the Navy intercept it at sea,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.800
could we have caught
those who smuggled diesel

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.010
or discovered the hideout

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.610
where the Tai Ho Brotherhood
concealed tungsten ore?

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.309
Tell me.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.789
Could we?

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.570
Only through a surprise attack in Macau

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.460
can we prevent our rivals

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.860
from destroying intelligence
about the delivery location.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.610
This way, we can track down
that massive tungsten ore shipment

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.510
and eliminate the Tai Ho Brotherhood
in one stroke.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.030
Once we catch them red-handed
on both ends,

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.410
the Portuguese Macau government's breach
of neutrality

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.120
and support for anti-Japanese activities
will be irrefutable.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.340
We can also use this to expose

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.870
the entire underground supply line
in Macau.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.870
But

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.010
now that things have
escalated to this point,

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.010
if the Portuguese Macau government
starts investigating,

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.940
how do you plan
to get out of this trouble?

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.680
The ones in trouble now are not us,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.340
but the Portuguese Macau government

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.520
and those anti-Japanese elements.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.120
They're completely overwhelmed
by the problems right now,

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:35.600
panicking like ants on a hot pan.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.480
How is it going?

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:55.820
We've finished checking.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.440
Among all of our men
who transported diesel,

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.900
only a man called Water Ghost

00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.670
went to see a doctor

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.070
and hasn't returned yet.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.670
Dr. Ke was right.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.820
There really is a mole.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.120
No wonder the timing was so spot-on,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.790
and the hijacking of the ship
took place so smoothly.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.360
The problem now is that Mr. Liang,

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.000
who was responsible
for navigation, is on the ship.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.970
I suspect that they've already learned
the information about our men

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.430
and the rendezvous point.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.890
And that Water Ghost knows

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.120
the complete communication system

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.450
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood's flag signals.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.910
So that means

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.420
if the Steamship Sai On continues
to sail for the rendezvous point,

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.480
Master Sanhe and his men
won't notice the danger.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.790
Instead, they will lead the enemy

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.700
to the actual tungsten ore handover site?

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.370
Exactly.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.940
Why did the Steamship Sai On

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.980
depart a full 7 hours ahead of schedule?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.870
I suspect that it was

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.870
because the Japanese wanted enough time
to send troops aboard.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:38.860
If I were the Japanese,

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.650
I'd definitely notify those in Zhongshan
to organize forces

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.780
and set up an ambush.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.390
Xiao Feng and I searched all over Macau.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.510
Every telephone and telegraph office

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.000
has been destroyed by the Japanese.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.100
My radio contact with Captain Ou is

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.250
scheduled once every 3 days.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.320
The next contact is the day after tomorrow
in the afternoon.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:51.770
So,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.080
in just a few hours,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.030
Master Sanhe and that shipment

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.740
of tungsten ore
will face a complete disaster.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.700
We need to quickly find a way

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.870
to send someone to notify Master Sanhe.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.620
No need.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.770
After learning
about the Steamship Sai On's incident,

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.120
Zhengping already left overnight

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.870
to find the guerrillas in Zhongshan.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.400
I hope it's not too late.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.050
The Portuguese Macau government
probably won't get away with this.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.800
Yes.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.610
Rodrigues, the guarantor
for the ship rental, got

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.740
the transit permit issued
by the Portuguese Macau government.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.370
And the diesel was

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.350
exchanged for tungsten ore
for the rear area.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.950
What do you think this means?

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200
This is already openly

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.220
supporting the Allied Forces
and China's resistance against Japan.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.480
If the Japanese use this as an excuse
to send troops to Macau,

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.640
we won't be able
to hold this position in Macau,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.170
and the entire supply line
will be destroyed.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.890
Now that things have come to this point,

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.440
I've got to take full responsibility

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.220
for the Steamship Sai On.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.920
Mr. Rodrigues...

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.790
I'm the registered merchant,

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.030
and I signed the ship rental guarantee.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.100
I can't escape the charge of smuggling

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.360
strategic resources anyway,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.740
so there's no need to drag the government

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.340
and all of Macau down with me.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.560
How about this?

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.500
Just claim that the government
knew nothing about it,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.500
and it was me who tricked you
into issuing the navigation permit.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.910
But you're the most influential
Portuguese merchant in Macau.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.500
This way, not only will you be done for,

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.150
but the Japanese will also not believe

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.940
that the government wasn't involved.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.370
There's no other way.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.770
The rest depends on the government's luck.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.750
Rodrigues,

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.340
where are you going?

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.160
After today,

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.960
I'll be a major smuggling criminal
to the Japanese.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.360
You should at least allow me to go home

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.090
to settle my business
and family affairs, right?

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:37.490
Comrade Ke Zhengping?

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.020
What's happening, Comrade Zhengping?

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:43.680
There's...

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.210
There's trouble.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.790
Mr. He?

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.270
Mr. Lok Pak,

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.070
you have all the declaration documents

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.870
for the Steamship Sai On, right?

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.700
Rifang,

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.670
go report the situation
to Captain Ou immediately.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.400
Understood.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.730
Di, let's go to Willow Bay.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.030
The tungsten ore is hidden there.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.690
So Master Sanhe must be there.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.230
Yes.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.570
I'll go with you.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.860
Comrade Ke Zhengping,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.080
you need to rest now.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.620
And your identity
must remain confidential.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.860
Leave everything to me.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:13.400
Let's go.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.400
Have the Japanese
seen this guarantee letter?

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.100
No.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.960
Guarantee letters are

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.320
only issued to the government

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.240
for renting public vessels.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.100
When the government requests passage
from the Japanese Naval Defense,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.760
there's no need to submit
these internal documents.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.790
So that means

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.300
the Japanese don't know
who the merchant is,

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.930
or who guaranteed the ship rental?

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.390
That's right, they don't.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.410
Mr. He,

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.700
what are you doing?

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.560
Prepare a blank guarantee letter
right away.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.890
We'll fill out a new one.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.510
Xian, what brings you here
to see me so urgently?

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.230
Good news.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.170
Would you like to make a big fortune?

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.710
Who wouldn't want to?

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.890
What? Did you get
a business opportunity for me, Xian?

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.280
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.320
After it's done,

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.820
I promise you'll make a fortune.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:16.860
What favor?

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.740
You should be quite familiar
with Wang Qizheng

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.410
from the Great Chinese Union, right?

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.850
His company belongs

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.740
to the Wang puppet government.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.630
And yes, they do a lot of business
with Lyun Coeng.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.430
Then if you leak some news to him,

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.090
he will believe you, right?

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.500
It depends on what kind of news.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:33.480
Good news.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:41.330
What did he say?

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.710
"Dock ahead. Load the cargo."

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:47.390
Huang Sanhe,

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.880
you have nowhere to escape this time.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.360
Qiu, notify County Magistrate Lin

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:52.790
to move.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.530
Got it!

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.140
Everyone, get ready!

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:01.770
Guys!

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.480
Time to get to work!

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.849
Guys! Load the tungsten ore!

00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.750
Haishan,

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.240
it's the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.640
They're all surrounded. What should we do?

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.200
Guys,

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.630
move quickly!

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.380
Hurry up!

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.400
Master Sanhe!

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.530
It's a trap! Run!

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.510
Oh, no. We are exposed.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:29.540
Attack!

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:42.290
Guys!

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.880
Charge!

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:44.990
Guys!

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.620
Grab your weapons!

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.850
That woman is a Communist.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.620
She's the one who came
to our place for contact.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.950
I-I've seen her before.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:54.780
Master Sanhe,

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.550
retreat now!

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.960
Haishan!

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.500
Di!

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.670
Di...

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:25.460
Run!

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.250
I'll take you with me.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:26.970
Hurry!

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.120
Di!

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.640
I'll take you away, okay?

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.740
I'll take you away.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:53.290
Go after them!

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.820
Get off the ship and pursue!

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.640
Move forward!

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:03.430
Turn the cannons!

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.530
Let's go!

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.540
Check if there are any survivors!

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.200
Okay!

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.960
Understood!

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.640
Haishan,

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:49.990
you're wounded.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.170
Let's go.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:54.970
Let's go.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.660
Chase them along the road!

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.330
Keep up!

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.550
General Manager,

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:31.580
you have a guest.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:33.120
Hongshen?

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:34.640
Come on, take a seat.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.200
Sorry, Xian.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.170
I'm not the one who wants to see you.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.010
I brought you another guest.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:43.780
Mr. He,

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:44.600
hello.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:46.370
Mr. Wang?

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:56.010
[Tai Fung Bank]

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:57.730
What diesel fuel?

00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:59.780
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.220
I don't have any.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.610
Well, Mr. He,

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.180
please stop hiding it from me.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.280
Manager He has already told me everything.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.090
You helped Rodrigues

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.400
get a big loan from Tai Fung Bank

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.470
to import an entire ship of diesel fuel,

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:18.000
right?

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.440
But unfortunately,

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.510
he encountered
the Portuguese-Japanese joint inspection.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:23.330
He had no choice

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.180
but to dump this hot potato back on you

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.460
to settle the payment.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.970
But you should know

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.450
that currently,

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.280
diesel is a strategic resource,

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.250
and it's already past
the declaration deadline.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.500
Now, you can neither sell your goods

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:40.750
nor repay the loan.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.890
And you're facing the charge

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.600
of concealing strategic resources
every day.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.030
You're between a rock and a hard place.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.200
Am I right?

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:52.890
He Hongshen,

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.780
what do you mean by this?

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.130
I asked to borrow money from you.
It's fine that you turned me down.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.530
But why did you betray me?

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.180
Xian, don't get worked up.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:03.900
Look.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:05.660
You wanted to borrow money
from my father-in-law

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.090
to temporarily cover the shortfall
in Tai Fung Bank's accounts.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.330
But I simply couldn't get

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.810
such a large sum of money for you.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.250
I suggested you sell the goods
to cover the payment,

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.050
but you refused
because Lyun Coeng is Japanese-owned.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.930
So I had to find you another buyer.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:22.130
Mr. Wang's Great Chinese Union is
at least Chinese-owned.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.930
His so-called Chinese-owned firm is
no different from Japanese-funded ones.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.110
Let's put aside
whether there's a difference.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.340
Mr. He, let me ask you just one thing.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:32.750
Right now,

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:33.550
in Macau,

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.950
can you find any company

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.940
that isn't openly Japanese-owned

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.820
but still dares to take

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.630
your undeclared strategic resources?

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.760
Apart from my Great Chinese Union,

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.450
can you find another one?

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.790
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.980
You should know very well
what kind of person I am.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.490
I would rather dump
all this diesel into Lingding Channel

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.730
than sell it to you.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:58.440
Fine.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:00.630
Quite a tough one.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.110
Then I'd like to see

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.950
if you, Mr. He, really can stick it out.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.300
General Manager.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.010
What's wrong?

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.760
Mr. Fu and all the shareholders
have suddenly arrived, asking

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.850
to hold a shareholders' meeting
to audit the accounts.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.250
They're all in the VIP room now,

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.650
waiting for you to reconcile the accounts.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:24.680
He Hongshen,

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.470
how much commission
did Wang Qizheng give you

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.100
to have you set me up like this?

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.630
You've really got me wrong,

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:31.380
Xian,

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.900
I only told Mr. Wang

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.380
about your accounting shortfall.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.740
I promise I did not leak any information

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.400
to Tai Fung Bank's directors.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:48.050
Mr. Wang, it was you
who notified Tai Fung Bank's shareholders,

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:48.750
right?

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:49.830
Yes.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.020
Right after you told me this information,

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.490
I immediately sent someone

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.090
to inform
all of Tai Fung Bank's shareholders.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.240
I think He Xian is

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.060
just a general manager.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.220
Without any authorization
from all shareholders,

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.510
he arbitrarily loaned out such a large sum

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.970
and cannot pay it back now.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:07.900
I think

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.000
their shareholders should
have the right to know.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.700
But aren't you forcing Xian
into a corner this way?

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.840
So what?

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.300
You know what kind of person he is.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.830
If I don't force him into a corner,

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.690
would he possibly be willing
to do business with me?

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.200
But anyway,

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.070
Manager He,

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.900
when you sold me this information,

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.900
didn't you also
take a full 10% commission?

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.220
Well, let me tell you.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.440
In business,

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.790
sometimes if you want to make money,

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.000
you have to set aside

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.270
your conscience.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:54.580
General Manager He,

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.640
we're waiting for your report.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:02.180
Please rest assured, directors.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.180
By the end of today,

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.910
I will definitely sort out these accounts

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.710
and give you all an explanation.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:27.880
H-How is she,

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.930
Comrade Zhengping?

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.620
The bullet is still lodged in her body.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.150
She needs surgery immediately,

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:32.950
otherwise...

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:36.830
There's no other way now.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:40.710
We must send Comrade Haishan
to Macau as soon as possible.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.360
Comrade Ou Xin,

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:44.380
I understand

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.400
the critical situation in Zhongshan.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.800
Since the enemy already found out
our contact point,

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.090
it proves that the Tai Ho Brotherhood

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.490
has a traitor among them.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.210
Mr. Liang, who was responsible
for navigation,

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.240
must have fallen into our enemy's hands.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.180
In other words,

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.160
the secret
of the entire supply line in Macau

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.890
could be exposed at any moment.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.110
They need you here.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.900
Just entrust me with the mission to escort

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:03.980
Comrade Long Haishan to Macau.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.030
You've been traveling all night.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.930
Don't worry, I can hang on.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.630
I'm familiar with Macau.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.500
Crossing the blockade,

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.230
fewer people

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.480
means a smaller target.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.380
It has to be me.

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.290
Well then...

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:16.350
We'll entrust

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:18.500
Haishan to you.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.360
Oh, right.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.360
Yang Chang's radio is online
around the clock,

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.970
maintaining constant communication
between Macau and Zhongshan.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:28.100
Whether we can protect the supply line

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.200
depends on communication
between both sides.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.260
I understand that.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.930
I promise I'll give it my all.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:33.930
Okay. Let's do it.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:35.460
Come on.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.220
Haishan.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:41.570
Comrades!

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.840
Grab your gear! We're pulling out!

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.560
Let's go!

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:54.830
Xian,

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.440
I really didn't leak the information

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.980
to your board of directors.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.100
Does it matter who did it now?

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:02.400
He Hongshen,

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:03.920
from now on,

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.760
you are no longer my friend.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.030
Mr. He,

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.440
why did you say that?

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.370
Manager He meant well.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.120
He was only trying to help you

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.980
get through this difficult time.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.310
Alright, fine.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.420
Today,

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.860
let's be frank with each other.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:26.930
I know

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.030
you look down on me, Wang Qizheng,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:29.720
and think

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.030
I'm a traitor to the country.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.290
Doing business with me

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:33.830
would tarnish your reputation.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.960
But Mr. He,

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.380
please think about this.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.470
Your current status

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.170
in Macau's business world

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:41.710
hasn't come easily.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.550
If you can't repay

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:45.900
the money because of this matter,

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.170
then in Macau's business community,

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.900
you'll be done for,

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.900
probably without any chance to recover.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.410
Right?

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.270
Fine, let's put this all aside.

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.400
Just that one charge

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.770
of concealing strategic resources.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:03.510
You know very well how serious

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:05.710
this crime is, don't you?

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.110
If you're thrown

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.890
into a Japanese prison because of it,

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.350
no matter how tough you are,

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.460
they'll break you down to dust anyway,

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.090
right?

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:19.810
So what?

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.310
The declaration deadline
has already passed.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:23.770
Even if I sell it to you now,

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.980
you could still snitch on me, right?

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.650
Well, if you sell the goods to me,

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.310
I promise you, Mr. He,

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:31.530
that you absolutely won't be charged

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.730
with concealing strategic resources.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.960
But the declaration deadline was
2 days ago.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.130
Then we'll backdate it by 3 days.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:40.990
You normally sold it

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:43.770
3 days ago,
before the declaration deadline.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.930
Even if it gets found out later,

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:47.810
it would be me, Wang Qizheng,
who didn't declare it.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.670
It would have nothing
to do with you, Mr. He.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:50.530
How about this?

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.570
Aren't you afraid

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.710
of being charged with these crimes?

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:58.530
Come on,

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.730
Mr. He.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.910
You know very well

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.390
what connections I, Wang Qizheng, have.

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:05.900
Let me be honest with you.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.140
This joint anti-smuggling thing is

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.310
actually just the Japanese
checking supplies.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:10.820
And my goods just belong

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.420
to the Japanese anyway.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.450
Why would they investigate
their own things?

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.330
But if this gets out...

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:22.740
Mr. He,

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.050
I know

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.660
you're worried

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.770
that if this gets out,

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.030
you, Mr. He, will end up
in an embarrassing situation in Macau.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:29.890
How about this?

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.770
Let's

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.750
secretly sign the contract

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.370
and transport the goods.

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.370
Let's keep it only

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.400
between you and me

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:39.440
and not let it get out.
That will do, right?

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.210
You can continue to be

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:42.620
respected and upright

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.180
as a man of dignity in Macau.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:45.720
Is that acceptable?

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:11.400
Mr. Liang!

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:14.600
As a master of the Brotherhood,

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:16.010
you must know everything

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:18.250
about what's behind the supply line.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.780
It's come to this point now.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.020
You'll have to say it sooner or later.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.350
Stop being so stubborn.

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:24.940
Pah!

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:29.260
Rat.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.900
You ungrateful and disloyal rat.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:35.920
You rat!

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:40.310
This old man is

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.000
really tight-lipped, huh?

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.090
Add more punishment.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.090
Go ahead, torture him more!

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.460
Wait.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.500
Old man,

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:57.660
you insist on being stubborn,

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.260
don't you?

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:01.100
Then don't blame me.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.510
County Magistrate Lin,

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:06.510
assign a few men

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:08.440
to go handle something with me.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:09.489
Okay.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:20.170
Chang.

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:21.909
Chang, we've got a signal.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:38.320
Report.

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:38.980
Go ahead.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.860
Our people in the county
have mobilized all our informants

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.610
in the puppet troops
and the puppet police force.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.260
The only information we've got is

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.880
that a master of the Tai Ho Brotherhood

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.780
has indeed been captured

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.320
and is now being interrogated
by Lin Nianci in person.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.120
That's all we know at the moment.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:53.239
I see.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.380
You may go rest now.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:54.989
Yes, sir.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:59.350
So it must be Mr. Liang without any doubt.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.810
Captain Ou,

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:03.040
don't worry.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.380
Zhong is a real man.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.670
He won't betray anyone,

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.620
even at the cost of his life.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.310
That's right.
Mr. Liang is tougher than steel.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.330
He won't let slip a single word
about our plan in Macau.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.910
Commander, what's the situation in Macau?

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:17.650
Mr. He

I didn't expect the traitor
to be Water Ghost.

It must be that female Communist.

There's only one possibility, I think.

must be seriously injured.
