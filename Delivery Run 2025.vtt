Lee? It's Lester.

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:05.643
We're still getting complaints
about you

00:03:05.644 --> 00:03:07.020
being late with orders.

00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:09.522
We got a rep to maintain.
Pick up the pace.

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.482
Also, the app is working fine.

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.109
Don't know what
you're talking about.

00:03:14.153 --> 00:03:16.070
Mr. Shaw. This is Jerry Olson

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:18.156
from the Northern Lights Casino.

00:03:18.157 --> 00:03:21.242
I'm calling because you
walked on quite a hefty tab

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:23.328
from the Dancing Fire
restaurant last night.

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.331
Um, if you are free
in the next few hours,

00:03:26.332 --> 00:03:29.126
we would like you to come
and take care of this.

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.128
Have a nice day.

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.714
Hello, Mr. Leland Shaw.
This is Carl Erickson.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.257
I'm calling to say
if you do not settle

00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:38.468
your late payments to us
in the next few hours...

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.094
Final notice?
That's the final--

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.888
...cut off your heat,
power, and water.

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.306
Hope this is crystal clear.

00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:47.560
The final notice?
Oh, lo and behold.

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.896
Okay, they're never
gonna get me.

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.481
They're never gonna get me.

00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:54.275
Hello, Leland. It's Gus.

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:57.737
I know you're busy,
but I need an answer from you.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:00.573
I can't afford to wait anymore.

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:04.744
I have another buyer who's going
to come back in a couple days.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:09.040
You want that food truck?
Then meet his price. Soon.

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.068
What's the matter?
You forgot one?

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.404
Ah!

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.170
Maid's day off, huh?

00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:59.216
Uh... Hey, Rebecca...

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:02.760
We've known each other
a long time, haven't we, Lee?

00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.470
Uh, yep.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.723
Been there to get you
out of every jam, right?

00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:10.018
Paid for cooking school.

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:12.353
And that culinary arts course
at college.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.564
All the good that did you.

00:05:14.565 --> 00:05:16.649
I can't remember.
Was it a year you

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.360
were there for?
- It was two.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.612
Two years. That's right.
That's right.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:25.867
You know, Lee,
I like to help people out.

00:05:25.868 --> 00:05:31.247
And when I do, I always
expect something in return.

00:05:31.248 --> 00:05:33.791
And frankly, I'm getting tired

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:36.210
of you continually
dicking me around

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:38.379
and not paying me back my money.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.633
It's enough to make one mad.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.595
I also heard that you were at
the Northern Lights last night.

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:50.267
That really,
really makes me mad.

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:56.105
Are you trying to strike rich
whilst gambling with my money?

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.649
I didn't lose all your money.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.028
No, I...
No, I got some. Not all of it.

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:04.030
But I can get the rest.

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.574
It's. Oh, no, no, uh...
Uh, wait.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:08.285
- Shh, shh, shh!
- Uh, I...

00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:10.287
Uh...

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:16.085
Oh my.

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.588
You're missing
about half. Too bad.

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.301
Hm.

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.512
Wait, stop!
Hey, hey, don't hurt him!

00:06:27.513 --> 00:06:31.349
You owe me 7,500 dollars, Lee.
And this ain't it!

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.268
- Ah, fuck! Okay, I can...
- You've been wasting

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:35.812
your time and mine.

00:06:35.813 --> 00:06:36.896
I'm gonna get you the money,

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.898
but just please,
put the fish down.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.275
Oh please, my ass.

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.069
Unless you're delivering
a mountain of food

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.530
to Jeff Bezos himself
on a regular basis,

00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:47.991
you ain't ever
gonna make your debt.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.284
You got nothing to bargain with.

00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:54.038
Look, I'm gonna get you
the 7,500.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.084
But just please
don't hurt Reggie!

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.294
Ugh!

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.549
That... would've been you.

00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:07.927
I'm giving you until
tomorrow morning

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:10.930
to get the forty-five hundred
that's missing.

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.599
You get that money
from your grandmother's purse,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.519
or you start an OnlyFans
account, I don't give a fuck

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.603
where it comes from.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:20.524
No one leaves me
with a debt unpaid.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.442
Mess up again,

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.570
and the both of you

00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:27.781
are going to end up being sushi.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.787
And tie your damn shoelaces.
You look like an idiot.

00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:39.209
- Hey, hey!
- Save it! Come on.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.135
Hey.

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:51.137
Oh, Reggie. Shit...

00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.182
Oh, man...

00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:57.144
Where am I gonna put you, man?

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:04.942
You know that I'm good
for the money.

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.777
I can make it all back.

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:11.490
Fast, in a few hours,
plus interest. Hm?

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.242
It's like a quick loan,

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:16.329
and you will see it
all back again.

00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:21.417
Yeah, well just think about it.
Huh?

00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:24.588
Okay. Okay, bye.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.353
It's like I'm...

00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:42.980
...driving you to school, buddy.

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.399
You behave, now.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.859
Good morning,
Nisswa!

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.194
Hope y'all are good out there.

00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:49.779
Seems the heavens
have opened up for us.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.781
You asked for snow?
Well, you got it.

00:08:51.782 --> 00:08:53.199
We got snow, people.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.617
Hope y'all remember to get
your winter tires.

00:08:54.618 --> 00:08:56.410
I mean, talk about
that weather, huh?

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.246
It's pretty darn
freezing out there, am I right?

00:08:58.247 --> 00:09:00.164
It's for sure gonna be another
short and cold day today,

00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.874
with temperatures
dropping to minus ten.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.292
Nisswa Police Department
has issued a warning

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.628
for all citizens to be careful
when out driving

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:07.505
in this weather.
Don't be stupid, people.

00:09:07.506 --> 00:09:09.382
You do not want to be
joy riding today.

00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:11.175
Trust me. Be safe out there.

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:13.010
But best to wrap up warm,
stoke up them fires,

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.804
and stay inside.

00:09:14.805 --> 00:09:15.972
We also got another statement

00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:17.390
from the Nisswa
Police Department:

00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:18.808
two more hikers up on
Greenwood Mountain

00:09:18.809 --> 00:09:20.601
have vanished.
They're not sure if it's wolves

00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:22.895
or bears or even aliens
from outer space.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.272
But our good
Chief Robert Hamilton,

00:09:24.273 --> 00:09:25.856
the rest of Nisswa Police
Department,

00:09:25.857 --> 00:09:28.359
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service is on the case.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.861
Just stay away from Greenwood
Mountain is what I'm saying--

00:09:36.118 --> 00:09:39.246
You real, motherfucker? Fuck!

00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:41.957
You think it's that bad, Reggie?

00:09:50.007 --> 00:09:51.717
Okay...

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.636
Yeah...

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:56.846
That's, uh...

00:09:56.847 --> 00:09:58.098
You missing something?

00:10:00.142 --> 00:10:02.435
I have no need for trophies.

00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:04.103
Why anyone would want to buy

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:07.023
a trophy someone else earned,
beyond me.

00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:08.275
We-- Uh...

00:10:09.568 --> 00:10:11.819
This blender's missing...
half a blender.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.071
Shit.

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:15.531
And I ain't running
a pet store.

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.491
Oh, he's... He's not for sale.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:25.833
Is... Is there anything here
that you really want?

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:27.085
Hm...

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.921
Take the coffee grinder
for 20 dollars. Steak knife, 50.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:33.550
- Twenty dollars?
- Take it or leave it.

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:46.520
Okay... Thanks.

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.064
Pleasure doing business
with you.

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:50.609
Yeah. Thank you, sir.

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:02.495
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:04.121
Save it, Tom.
You got my order?

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.749
Here you go.
Coffee and donuts.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.876
One classic American
breakfast ready to go.

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:11.588
And, hey, don't dilly-dally.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:14.965
By the way, I, uh,

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:18.094
heard you got in pretty deep
into Rebecca's pocket.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.914
Come on, man.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.571
Big fella. Ain't he, Reggie?

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:05.243
Sure is getting his money's
worth today with all this snow.

00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:08.538
Oh, oh!

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.166
Road hog!

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.377
Yeah, go s... Go, uh...

00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:18.715
...plow somewhere else.

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:21.134
Fat-ass.

00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:40.236
There you go.

00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:42.531
Hey! What the f...?

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:00.590
We got a long day ahead of us.

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:04.010
Come on!

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:06.721
Come on, fuck!

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:09.224
Ah, fuck...

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:13.185
I don't care what
the tech guys say, Lester,

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.812
there's something
wrong with the app.

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.689
Have you checked the Wi-Fi?

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.774
Wi-Fi? What Wi-Fi?

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.194
I've been driving around
outside all day.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.366
Look at our life, Reggie.

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:31.495
Reginald?
Are you listening to me? Hey!

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:34.582
I need some good
and high-paying orders, Lester.

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:38.460
I've had, like, three today.
I should've had hundreds by now.

00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:41.755
We're a big company, Lee.
We got a lot of drivers.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:44.216
Why not send some
of that stuff my way?

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:47.344
Goddammit. Goddammit...

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:49.471
Lee, if you're not
happy at RabbitEats,

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.181
there's nothing wrong
with throwing in the towel

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:52.766
and trying something else.

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.768
I can't afford
to do something else right now.

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:56.313
I need the money.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.775
Oh. Thanks, Joe. Yeah,
just, uh, put it in the bag.

00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:12.037
Oh...

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.251
Hey! Hey, Gus!

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:21.671
Lee, did you get
my message this morning?

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:25.674
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just, uh,
I'm just working right now, Gus.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:30.971
Listen, can-can I call you back?
Uh, maybe, uh, between orders?

00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:34.099
I need an answer, Lee.
You can't keep me waiting.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.728
Do you have the money
for food truck or no?

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.816
Yeah, I, I just need
a little more time--

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.610
You said that last week.

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:47.530
If you want it,
you've got to pick up the pace.

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:55.621
The other buyer, he's really
interested. I told you.

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:58.415
- Come on!
- What did you say?

00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:00.834
I-I'm gonna call you back.

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:12.471
Is a goddamn six-year-old
driving this thing?

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:14.474
What the hell is going on?

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.113
Oh!

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:31.282
Damn you, Mr. Plow.

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.081
What is this yo-yo on?

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.136
Christ!

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:55.264
Oh! Oh...

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:25.211
Hey, Howard. You got my order?
- Oh, look who it is!

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:30.591
We're a little bit backed up
here today, Lee.

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.802
Go grab a soda.
We'll get to you.

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:43.228
Is it "Bring Your Pet
to Work" day?

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:46.608
Nope, Reggie's
my co-pilot today.

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:03.833
"We come from outer space!"

00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:05.794
What do you think, Reggie?

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.345
Where is this place?

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.306
Is this still Nisswa?

00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:30.108
What? Goddamn psycho.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.111
What's this now?

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.417
What is wrong with
people today, Reggie?

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:53.006
Come on.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.023
There we go.

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:23.704
Hey, Leland! Whatcha doing?

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:26.039
You do realize you're blocking
the path?

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.666
People like me got places to be.

00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.835
Yeah, didn't you see the truck
that was in my way?

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:33.882
Oh, yah! Sure did.
Looks like he was lost, huh?

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:38.678
Poor guy.
Must've taken a wrong turn.

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:41.388
Happens to all of us. Ha!

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:48.437
Anyway, I'll be seeing you.
- Wait, Nathan.

00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:50.856
- I've got things to do.
- Nathan.

00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:53.859
- I've got places to be.
- Oh? S-See ya.

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.238
See ya...

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.578
Give me something.

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:12.836
Sixty-five.
That's sixty-five.

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:15.839
- Yes.
- After that, we have sixty-one.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.507
- No.
- Sixty-one.

00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:18.926
- Shit!
- Good luck to all

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:20.345
the winners out there.

00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:25.265
Reggie, I gotta stay awake, man.

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:26.767
Come on, don't give me that.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:33.441
Oh, shit! Come on... No?

00:20:37.862 --> 00:20:40.489
I know that I'm giving up.

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.881
You're a wise guy, Reggie.
You're a wise guy.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:00.009
A man of few words, if you will.

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:06.473
You don't say much,
but uh, when you do,

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.184
it's some philosophical shit.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.006
Oh, fuck!

00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:15.083
What?

00:22:18.129 --> 00:22:21.965
What, has he got, like, a plane
engine hooked up to that thing?

00:22:59.754 --> 00:23:01.672
Back off, dude!

00:23:08.846 --> 00:23:10.723
Shit.

00:23:42.213 --> 00:23:43.714
Fuck!

00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:08.363
Where... Where the fuck
did he go?

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.785
Where the fuck did he go? Fuck!

00:24:14.412 --> 00:24:16.539
What?

00:24:17.999 --> 00:24:22.587
What? Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.775
Oh, hiya, Lee.

00:24:47.236 --> 00:24:49.405
Looks like you're not the only
one on your lunch break.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.158
What's with the fish?

00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:56.328
Uh, he's just tagging
along today.

00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:58.955
Good, uh...
Good seeing you again, Nathan.

00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:01.625
Hey! Come on.

00:25:01.626 --> 00:25:04.794
It's Deputy Cummings.
Can't you see the badge? Jeez.

00:25:04.795 --> 00:25:06.796
Oh, yeah. Deputy.

00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:10.467
Say, you sped off earlier
before I could--

00:25:10.468 --> 00:25:13.595
Yeah, well, uh,
I was in a rush. You know?

00:25:13.596 --> 00:25:17.349
And I'm mad and cold as hell.
- Huh.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.975
I've had to deal with a bunch
of idiots

00:25:18.976 --> 00:25:21.061
who don't listen
to the local morning radio.

00:25:21.062 --> 00:25:26.858
Dead Man's Curve is closed
until further notice.

00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:30.654
Or for good so the dumb-dumbs
don't kill themselves.

00:25:30.655 --> 00:25:34.282
Huh. Have you, uh,
got anything else to report?

00:25:34.283 --> 00:25:37.786
God, I am not some
Chatty Cathy

00:25:37.787 --> 00:25:42.458
like everyone else down at HQ.
You know that.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.794
But...

00:25:45.795 --> 00:25:48.171
between you and me,

00:25:48.172 --> 00:25:51.425
we've got ourselves
a wild animal situation.

00:25:52.593 --> 00:25:55.637
You heard about
those missing hikers?

00:25:55.638 --> 00:25:57.848
Yeah. I listen
to the morning radio.

00:25:58.516 --> 00:26:01.227
We haven't found
any sign of them yet.

00:26:01.936 --> 00:26:04.230
They just vanished.

00:26:05.314 --> 00:26:07.692
Like Alferd Packer's party.

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.699
Dumb big city slickers.

00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:18.660
You know, they should've just
watched Deliverance

00:26:18.661 --> 00:26:21.372
and stayed home.

00:26:24.417 --> 00:26:26.127
Bunch of dumb-dumbs.

00:26:26.836 --> 00:26:30.422
Huh? Bunch of dumb-dumbs
lost in the snow.

00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:34.426
Thought you said that you had
a wild animal situation.

00:26:34.427 --> 00:26:36.428
Oh...

00:26:36.429 --> 00:26:38.514
No, no, no, no, no...

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.684
That's just a theory,
down at HQ.

00:26:42.685 --> 00:26:47.564
Anyway. I'm on my break,
so I'll be seeing you, now.

00:26:47.565 --> 00:26:50.067
- Hey, Deputy.
- Mm-hmm?

00:26:53.571 --> 00:26:57.116
Um... I wanna report
an attempted murder.

00:26:58.326 --> 00:26:59.535
A what?

00:27:01.037 --> 00:27:05.499
An attempted murder? Ooh!
Okay.

00:27:06.042 --> 00:27:07.376
So...

00:27:08.419 --> 00:27:10.670
some truck driver...
- Yeah?

00:27:10.671 --> 00:27:13.131
...with a snowplow...

00:27:13.132 --> 00:27:16.801
tried to run me off the road
today several times.

00:27:16.802 --> 00:27:19.929
And we nearly got hurt,
me and Reggie.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.849
It was the same
truck from earlier.

00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:27.646
- Okay. Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.274
Which one was it?

00:27:41.577 --> 00:27:46.248
Well, um... I-I didn't see
this one's license plate.

00:27:50.378 --> 00:27:52.171
What?

00:27:55.049 --> 00:27:56.966
Oh, Leland.

00:27:56.967 --> 00:28:00.845
We don't exactly have
a lot to go on now, do we?

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:03.515
You know, maybe it was
someone you pissed off.

00:28:03.516 --> 00:28:06.976
You do have that tendency
to vex people, you know?

00:28:06.977 --> 00:28:08.728
I guess that's why
Rebecca's gunning for you.

00:28:08.729 --> 00:28:10.313
Yeah, I am getting
my shit together,

00:28:10.314 --> 00:28:12.357
but you guys should still
do something about her.

00:28:12.358 --> 00:28:14.025
Regardless of what you say,

00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:15.652
she ain't done nothing

00:28:15.653 --> 00:28:18.613
to get herself arrested
for any kind of crime.

00:28:18.614 --> 00:28:21.033
Hey, look. Look.

00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:27.997
In regards to your, uh...
truck driver.

00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:32.210
If you see it again,
you know the number.

00:28:32.211 --> 00:28:34.129
It's...

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.425
911.

00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:39.384
See you soon.

00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:58.529
Thank God.

00:29:00.114 --> 00:29:01.615
Ah, it's...

00:29:11.709 --> 00:29:14.086
- I'll be right with you.
- Okay.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:43.699
Oh.

00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:49.037
Uh...

00:29:49.038 --> 00:29:51.874
Hey, wa... wait a minute. Um...

00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:56.545
It's up on the mountain?

00:29:58.088 --> 00:29:59.715
"Greenwood Mountain."

00:30:02.218 --> 00:30:04.136
Looks like
we're doing it, Reggie.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.694
Going up the mountain,
are we, eh?

00:30:22.738 --> 00:30:24.782
Yep. Appears so.

00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:29.578
Ever heard of the Dyatlov Pass
incident?

00:30:31.372 --> 00:30:35.960
Nine Soviets went out hiking
in the Ural Mountains.

00:30:38.254 --> 00:30:42.174
All of them died
under mysterious circumstances.

00:30:44.802 --> 00:30:47.887
No one's ever been able
to figure out why.

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:55.229
Greenwood Mountain
is just as dangerous.

00:31:32.808 --> 00:31:34.226
Right.

00:32:20.064 --> 00:32:21.440
Okay...

00:32:26.487 --> 00:32:30.239
Not even a thank
you or good evening. Hm.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.659
People these days...

00:32:36.455 --> 00:32:37.665
Oh.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.044
Ask and you shall receive.

00:32:45.089 --> 00:32:46.840
Alright.

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:53.097
There we go.

00:32:54.264 --> 00:32:55.683
Ah...

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.729
Oh-ho!

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.274
That's how you do it.

00:33:05.275 --> 00:33:06.944
Right.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.697
Okay.

00:33:11.115 --> 00:33:12.700
Hey, Reggie.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:44.374
Must plow a lot of snow,
this asshole.

00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:02.059
Wait... 14 doll...?

00:35:03.644 --> 00:35:05.437
Fucking kidding me?

00:35:06.063 --> 00:35:09.857
You kidding me? Huh?
Asshole driver.

00:35:09.858 --> 00:35:11.985
Asshole! Gonna tip?

00:35:30.337 --> 00:35:32.840
Jeez. Argh...

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.346
Screw this.

00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:45.477
Whoa. Um...

00:35:51.525 --> 00:35:54.903
S... Sorry! Um...

00:35:59.241 --> 00:36:00.659
Hello?

00:36:06.832 --> 00:36:08.542
Um...

00:36:15.883 --> 00:36:18.218
Hello? Is-Is anybody home?

00:36:23.307 --> 00:36:27.853
Oh, Mr. Plow, you, uh...
you're missing a tip!

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:32.690
And you owe me some money for
the damages you did to my car.

00:36:32.691 --> 00:36:37.696
Okay, so, so...
so pay up or, uh, lawyer up.

00:36:38.488 --> 00:36:40.073
Yeah.

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.788
Righteous...

00:37:14.608 --> 00:37:17.110
What's this?

00:37:20.197 --> 00:37:21.948
Oh.

00:37:21.949 --> 00:37:25.577
Handsome devil. Prick.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:29.748
Okay. That should be enough
for Deputy Cummings.

00:38:05.242 --> 00:38:06.618
Hello?

00:38:08.036 --> 00:38:11.248
Mark? Fuck...

00:39:53.475 --> 00:39:56.393
Why-- I don't know what
to, uh... Where is...?

00:39:58.438 --> 00:39:59.731
Where's the...?

00:40:07.864 --> 00:40:09.282
Okay...

00:40:16.832 --> 00:40:18.457
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:40:18.458 --> 00:40:19.917
What the hell are you doing? I--

00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:21.294
Shh, shh.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.508
I turned the music off.

00:40:27.509 --> 00:40:30.178
Oh! Hey, hey, hey, hey...

00:40:49.948 --> 00:40:53.368
Oh, jeez...
I'm not staying here.

00:40:58.206 --> 00:41:00.417
What are you doing? Hey!

00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:07.132
Hey, look, I think we just get
the fuck out of here, okay?

00:41:07.799 --> 00:41:10.177
Oh, fuck...

00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:15.849
Look. Listen to me, okay?
Just, just...

00:41:23.273 --> 00:41:24.523
What are you doing?

00:41:27.903 --> 00:41:30.572
No, no, no, no! Go!

00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:39.706
What?

00:41:40.916 --> 00:41:43.042
What are you...
What are you doing?

00:41:43.043 --> 00:41:45.003
What the hell is she doing?

00:41:50.884 --> 00:41:52.219
Fuck...

00:41:57.807 --> 00:41:59.851
Fuck...

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:02.103
Fuck!

00:42:15.408 --> 00:42:16.534
Fuck.

00:42:21.248 --> 00:42:23.165
We're getting the hell
out of here, Reggie!

00:42:50.986 --> 00:42:53.446
What the fuck was that?

00:42:56.116 --> 00:42:58.076
What the fuck was that?

00:43:00.787 --> 00:43:03.915
Not righteous. Not righteous.

00:43:10.964 --> 00:43:14.508
No, no, don't!
No, come on! Come on, no!

00:43:14.509 --> 00:43:16.677
Fuck! Fuck!

00:43:16.678 --> 00:43:19.347
Please...

00:43:57.052 --> 00:44:00.929
Oh, Nathan... I am so glad
to see you. Jesus Christ.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.306
Jesus Christ indeed.

00:44:02.307 --> 00:44:04.391
What kind of driving was that?
Forget it's winter?!

00:44:04.392 --> 00:44:06.101
Nathan, what...

00:44:06.102 --> 00:44:09.146
Listen to me. Okay?
Listen, you gotta--

00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:11.398
I'm up here looking
for the missing hikers, okay?

00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:12.983
I find some wrecked car
in the trees in there.

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:15.778
It's so weird.
And now this. Are you drunk?

00:44:15.779 --> 00:44:17.321
'Cause that was some
reckless driving.

00:44:17.322 --> 00:44:19.114
And stop calling me Nathan!

00:44:19.115 --> 00:44:20.949
It's Deputy Cummings!

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:23.118
You better give me
the answers, buddy.

00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:25.329
And Leland... This goddamn fish.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:27.206
Nathan, you need to get
on the walkie-talkie, okay?

00:44:27.207 --> 00:44:29.416
Right now.
There is someone after me.

00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:31.877
Mr. Plow! Okay? The snowplow
truck guy

00:44:31.878 --> 00:44:33.212
that-that was from before.

00:44:33.213 --> 00:44:35.798
He's got...
He's got some murder lodge

00:44:35.799 --> 00:44:38.217
up in the mountains, okay?
A woman is dead!

00:44:38.218 --> 00:44:39.551
- Mr. Plow?
- Yeah,

00:44:39.552 --> 00:44:41.512
you need to call in the cavalry!
- Leland, Mr. P--

00:44:41.513 --> 00:44:45.266
Mr. Plow? What are you smoking?
Huh? What are you smoking?

00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:48.894
- What...
- Is that your blood?

00:44:48.895 --> 00:44:50.396
Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

00:44:50.397 --> 00:44:52.356
Is that your blood?

00:44:52.357 --> 00:44:55.192
Goddammit, get out of the car.

00:44:55.193 --> 00:44:56.985
Get out!

00:44:56.986 --> 00:44:58.405
Hands!

00:44:59.114 --> 00:45:01.573
You know, Leland,
this is just...

00:45:01.574 --> 00:45:03.200
This is too much.

00:45:03.201 --> 00:45:06.745
This is too much, okay?
Now we gotta go.

00:45:06.746 --> 00:45:12.210
You understand? Okay?
We gotta go. Hm?

00:45:17.298 --> 00:45:19.008
Wait, you're not even gonna
read me my rights?

00:45:19.926 --> 00:45:21.885
Your rights?

00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:24.389
Shut up, Leland.
Just get in the car.

00:45:25.432 --> 00:45:27.642
Watch your head. Jeez.

00:45:31.479 --> 00:45:33.189
Goddammit.

00:45:38.695 --> 00:45:41.405
Moron... You need to get
someone up here!

00:45:41.406 --> 00:45:43.157
Hey, hey, hey!

00:45:43.158 --> 00:45:45.910
No need for name-calling, jeez.

00:45:47.287 --> 00:45:49.037
Dispatch, this is Car 22--

00:45:49.038 --> 00:45:51.666
Nathan, you're making
a mistake!

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.793
It's Deputy Cummings!
Now, shut up!

00:45:54.794 --> 00:45:57.297
Dispatch. What's your status?

00:45:58.089 --> 00:46:00.841
Yeah, dispatch.
I was on Greenwood Mountain,

00:46:00.842 --> 00:46:02.384
searching for
the missing hikers.

00:46:02.385 --> 00:46:04.595
I got a suspect,
who was driving erratically.

00:46:04.596 --> 00:46:07.306
And uh, he's got blood on him.
It's not his own.

00:46:07.307 --> 00:46:09.976
Suspect's name is Leland Shaw.
I'm bringing him in.

00:46:12.687 --> 00:46:14.271
What the hell is that?

00:46:14.272 --> 00:46:19.526
- Nathan, drive!
- I told you to shut up. Okay?

00:46:19.527 --> 00:46:22.529
Look, let me just see
what this guy wants.

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:27.242
No, no, no, that's Mr. Plow!
No! No, get in the car!

00:46:27.243 --> 00:46:30.705
Hey! What seems to be
the trouble here?

00:46:32.707 --> 00:46:34.833
Turn off your engine
and get out of the truck,

00:46:34.834 --> 00:46:36.294
please!

00:46:38.838 --> 00:46:40.881
Hey. Hey, Leland!

00:46:40.882 --> 00:46:43.842
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

00:46:43.843 --> 00:46:45.512
Leland!

00:46:46.346 --> 00:46:48.847
Hey! Where are you going?

00:46:51.935 --> 00:46:53.060
Stop!

00:47:04.572 --> 00:47:05.615
Hey! Ahh!

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.415
Fucking Nathan...

00:47:15.542 --> 00:47:18.085
Deputy fucking Cummings.
Asshole.

00:47:18.086 --> 00:47:21.129
Fucking Deputy fucking Dickwad!

00:47:26.219 --> 00:47:28.221
Shit...

00:47:32.684 --> 00:47:34.727
Fucking Nathan...

00:47:36.145 --> 00:47:38.565
This is so fucked.

00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:53.538
Really?

00:48:20.064 --> 00:48:22.442
Keep that away from my pumps!

00:48:57.477 --> 00:49:00.438
You break out of prison?
- I have to use the phone.

00:49:01.981 --> 00:49:03.815
You gonna pay for
that water, sir?

00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:07.278
Yeah. Fine. Yeah.

00:49:08.905 --> 00:49:12.032
- Thanks.
- Phone now? Please.

00:49:12.033 --> 00:49:14.034
- The phone's not working.
- What?

00:49:14.035 --> 00:49:16.286
Cheapskate owner
didn't pay his phone bills.

00:49:16.287 --> 00:49:18.539
What? Aren't-aren't
you the owner?

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:21.083
Sorry.

00:49:21.084 --> 00:49:23.627
Well, okay,
do you have a cell phone?

00:49:23.628 --> 00:49:27.965
Uh, an iPhone? Android?
Fucking BlackBerry?

00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:36.891
Uh... Twenty...
Twenty dollars on Pump 2.

00:49:43.523 --> 00:49:46.858
Hey, hey, hey, you got
a cell phone, right?

00:49:46.859 --> 00:49:48.695
No? Fuck!

00:51:07.273 --> 00:51:10.567
Oh, now they start coming in?

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.993
Fuck!

00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:28.479
Ah, come on, you fuck! Ah!

00:52:33.442 --> 00:52:34.443
Ah!

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.934
Oh, God...

00:54:35.398 --> 00:54:36.941
What?

00:54:37.817 --> 00:54:39.860
Oh, shit...

00:55:39.962 --> 00:55:43.674
Yeah! Take that, motherfucker!

00:55:47.303 --> 00:55:50.890
That's right! Fuck yeah!

00:55:51.474 --> 00:55:52.725
Woo!

00:56:02.026 --> 00:56:03.276
Fuck.

00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:04.903
Good morning, princess.

00:56:04.904 --> 00:56:06.821
- Where...
- Don't worry.

00:56:06.822 --> 00:56:09.240
You're fine. A-okay.

00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:12.494
You just had a little bump.
That's all. So, take it easy.

00:56:12.495 --> 00:56:16.082
- Wh-Where am I?
- You had a little accident.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.710
Hey. Hey, what...?

00:56:22.505 --> 00:56:23.672
Um...

00:56:24.507 --> 00:56:26.175
Yeah, I...

00:56:36.936 --> 00:56:39.354
Guys, I-I still got time.

00:56:39.355 --> 00:56:42.357
Do you think this is
playtime in the park?

00:56:42.358 --> 00:56:45.151
That amount
right there is pitiful.

00:56:45.152 --> 00:56:47.779
Have you been driving around
with your thumb up your ass?

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.657
And then when we catch you,
you try to run out on us?

00:56:50.658 --> 00:56:52.742
You're dumber than you look.

00:56:52.743 --> 00:56:54.369
You were following me?

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:57.413
We were keeping an eye on you.
Just in case.

00:56:57.414 --> 00:57:00.000
And boy, were we right.

00:57:00.918 --> 00:57:03.545
Couldn't push enough chop suey, huh?

00:57:03.546 --> 00:57:05.713
I mean, we almost lost you there
for a little bit.

00:57:05.714 --> 00:57:08.049
But then we found you again.

00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:10.468
Lady Luck shines down on us now.

00:57:10.469 --> 00:57:12.262
I wasn't running
away from you--

00:57:12.263 --> 00:57:14.765
I'll be the judge of that,
you little prick!

00:57:22.064 --> 00:57:23.899
- Give me my fish.
- Excuse me?

00:57:25.192 --> 00:57:26.734
Give me my damn fish.

00:57:26.735 --> 00:57:30.113
Ah, I didn't quite catch that.
What did you say?

00:57:30.114 --> 00:57:33.158
Please, give me
my damn fish, Rebecca!

00:57:33.159 --> 00:57:37.078
Oh! This little guy?
Yeah, sure.

00:57:39.832 --> 00:57:40.915
Huh.

00:57:40.916 --> 00:57:42.750
Um...

00:57:42.751 --> 00:57:45.503
I know this going to make me
sound like a jerk-ass,

00:57:45.504 --> 00:57:48.089
and this is badly timed,
but I, um,

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:49.716
I got his order ready.

00:57:49.717 --> 00:57:53.136
Joe, could you fuck off, please?

00:57:53.137 --> 00:57:54.512
You betcha.

00:57:56.348 --> 00:57:58.392
You got something
to say there, Lee?

00:57:59.643 --> 00:58:02.770
What kind of people you got
working for you, Rebecca?

00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:07.192
'Cause I'd say you got some
sick fucks in your employment.

00:58:07.193 --> 00:58:08.735
Come again?

00:58:08.736 --> 00:58:10.403
Who's the psycho

00:58:10.404 --> 00:58:13.823
in the snowplow truck that
you got working for you? Hm?

00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:15.825
Excuse me, the snowplow truck?

00:58:15.826 --> 00:58:18.161
The guy with
the snowplow truck, Rebecca!

00:58:18.162 --> 00:58:20.371
Mr. Plow!
- I don't know what the hell

00:58:20.372 --> 00:58:22.957
you're talking about, Lee.

00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:25.543
You got a phone
in this shithole?

00:58:25.544 --> 00:58:27.462
Yeah. Just out here.

00:58:27.463 --> 00:58:30.007
Go make the call.
Get the boys here.

00:59:15.803 --> 00:59:18.055
I was gonna buy a food truck.

00:59:19.473 --> 00:59:23.769
I was gonna make food
for people, be my own boss.

00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:26.896
I had it all planned,
all figured out.

00:59:26.897 --> 00:59:29.023
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

00:59:29.024 --> 00:59:31.442
I know you're a good guy, Lee.

00:59:31.443 --> 00:59:33.903
Despite all the shit
thrown your way,

00:59:33.904 --> 00:59:35.697
and all not making
your lucky break,

00:59:35.698 --> 00:59:37.657
you still persevere.

00:59:37.658 --> 00:59:40.410
- Yeah.
- It's commendable.

00:59:40.411 --> 00:59:41.869
But you're just
one of those guys

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:45.290
that keeps on making
the same mistakes.

00:59:45.291 --> 00:59:46.958
You're like a drunk at the bar

00:59:46.959 --> 00:59:49.002
who doesn't know when
to quit and go home.

00:59:49.003 --> 00:59:50.962
And this is what happens

00:59:50.963 --> 00:59:53.340
when you run out
on paying a debt back to me.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:52.065
What the hell?

01:00:52.066 --> 01:00:55.319
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Shut up, Lee!

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:37.463
Shit...

01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:03.446
You fucking animal!

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.454
Quick...

01:03:16.919 --> 01:03:18.712
Please.

01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:21.715
I'm sorry.

01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:02.589
Okay...

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:23.526
Where's a cop when you need one?

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:27.447
We're gonna be fine, buddy.

01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:35.455
Okay...

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.628
What?

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.673
No...

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:55.391
Dead Man's Curve
is closed until further notice.

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.393
Shit...

01:04:57.394 --> 01:05:01.106
Fucking Nathan, fuck.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.386
Come on!

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.701
Oh... fuck it!

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:39.245
What do you want from me?!

01:06:39.246 --> 01:06:41.498
What do you want from me?

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:53.802
Leave me alone!

01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:25.709
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:29.880
Fuck! Please, please!

01:07:31.173 --> 01:07:36.136
Please, leave me alone! Please!

01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:39.389
No!

01:07:51.026 --> 01:07:54.988
Fuck! Hold on, Reggie!

01:08:07.626 --> 01:08:09.294
Oh, please, God!

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.360
Oh!

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:23.535
Let... me... go!

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:11.411
What's his name?

01:12:13.705 --> 01:12:15.206
Reggie.

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:19.544
I had a turtle once.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.797
Called him Buck.

01:12:25.717 --> 01:12:27.427
Great.

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.432
Told you the mountain
was dangerous.

01:12:39.147 --> 01:12:41.232
Got any tools on you?

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.402
Good morning,
Nisswa.

01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:48.864
Another cold and frosty morning.
But at least it ain't snowing.

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:51.283
So, now down
to serious business.

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:52.868
Top story of the day
is what's being referred to

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:55.871
by the police
as "the snowplow massacre".

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:58.248
Reports have been heard
of a maniacal snowplow

01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:00.084
truck driver causing mayhem.

01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:03.045
A house of murder was discovered
on Greenwood Mountain.

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:05.339
And multiple fatalities
found at a local pizzeria

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:09.218
outside of town,
with one female survivor.

01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:11.095
Police have yet
to comment further on this case.

01:13:11.096 --> 01:13:15.100
But stay tuned for more on this
ongoing and breaking story.

01:13:16.101 --> 01:13:18.519
Throw it away,
heat it up in the microwave.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.730
I don't give a shit.

01:13:23.775 --> 01:13:25.527
Why the hell are you
only wearing one shoe?

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:28.530
How much for this?

01:13:55.807 --> 01:13:57.516
Hello? This is Lee.

01:13:57.517 --> 01:14:00.269
Leland! Where the hell
have you been?

01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:02.354
I've been after you all night.
What's the matter?

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:04.398
You complain about orders
not coming in,

01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:06.733
but then they do come in,
and you ignore them all?

01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:09.111
What the hell is wrong with you?
What kept you?

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:10.529
Up yours, Lester.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.782
What? Excus--

01:14:17.412 --> 01:14:19.997
Hey, Gus. It's Lee.

01:14:19.998 --> 01:14:21.331
What do you want, Lee?

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:23.834
You want more
of our time to waste?

01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:27.588
I got your money.
Now, that food truck is mine.

01:14:27.589 --> 01:14:30.549
You can tell those other buyers
to go spit.

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:33.010
You got the money? You?

01:14:33.011 --> 01:14:35.554
You better not be telling me
some tall tale.

01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:37.598
Nope. Nope, it's real.

01:14:37.599 --> 01:14:40.309
Alright. Sounds like
we're in business.

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:43.729
You want to come by my office
and check it out?

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:46.940
You mind
if I come by tomorrow?

01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:48.985
I had myself a rough night.
