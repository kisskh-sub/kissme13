(Father,)

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.879
(your lies made me suffer.)

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.760
(Turns out, what you want)

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:24.199
(is just a useful pawn.)

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.480
(All the glory and splendor you gave me)

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.200
(was actually exchanged with my father,)

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.840
(and the Li Army's sacrifice.)

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.359
(In the eyes of other people,)

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.200
(this is just a joke and a humiliation.)

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:50.039
(I had no choice back then.)

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.679
(I do now.)

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.960
(This time, I choose)

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.399
(to end everything on my own.)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.890
(At the flower appreciation banquet
that year,)

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.159
(the descendants of Wang Sun lied
and said I was a merchant's daughter.)

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.600
(They laughed at you
for being an orphan.)

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.000
(We promised to be buddies forever.)

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.640
(Now, all that love
has completely drifted away.)

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.079
(Wan'er,)

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.799
(one's nobility is unrelated
to one's background.)

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.120
(It's only related to their choices.)

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.520
(Promise me.)

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.000
(If the next life exists,)

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.039
(don't lose yourself again.)

(Just burn all the traitors of the Shen family)

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.360
Xiao Huaijin is extremely sly.

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.639
He pinned all the crimes on Prince Duan.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.159
Even the emperor was lied to.

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.560
If we want to punish him,

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.719
we need irrefutable evidence.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.620
There'll always be a flaw.

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.319
We will surely find a way.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.680
Sister!

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:28.920
Yunqi!

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:31.279
Yunqi!

00:04:32.957 --> 00:04:33.994
Sister,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160
Father gave me something.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.639
What...

00:04:39.575 --> 00:04:40.680
What did you call me?

00:04:41.462 --> 00:04:42.480
Sister.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.079
You call me Sister?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.439
You call me Sister.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.920
When I fell asleep that day,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.560
I heard

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.040
everything you said.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.199
You are my sister.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.240
Mother and Father are gone.

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:11.040
Sister,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.600
can you not

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.959
abandon me anymore?

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.519
I will never

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:22.879
abandon you, Yunqi.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.399
Yunqi,

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:52.560
did you say

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.360
Father gave you something?

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.680
That day,

00:05:57.225 --> 00:05:59.383
Father took me to his study.

00:06:05.425 --> 00:06:06.362
(Wang Yanqing, Chen Shouyu)

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.959
Yunqi,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.120
go and play alone.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.920
I'll come and be with you later.
All right?

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:13.879
Go.

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:29.862
I'm sure Mr. Shen
purposely left this behind.

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:31.439
These people

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:32.959
used to serve Prince Duan.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.439
They were his accomplices
in selling iron ore.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.300
Father must have found out
about Prince Duan's wrongdoing

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:39.759
and wouldn't work with him.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.690
That was why he was
framed by Prince Duan.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.790
After Father knew the people
of the imperial court had come for him,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.319
he secretly hid this list

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.000
in Yunqi's shirt

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:53.879
only hoping

00:06:54.537 --> 00:06:55.519
for this list

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.959
to prove the Shen family's innocence.

00:07:03.987 --> 00:07:05.319
With this list,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.850
we will surely find evidence
that proves Xiao Huaijin's crime.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.680
Governor, spare me!

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:16.920
I'll admit everything!

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:19.480
Don't move!

00:07:26.562 --> 00:07:29.991
(Snow flies in June.)

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:33.399
(The whole family cries
out of grievance)

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.079
(like Dou E, her grievance still haunts)

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:38.171
(All of Shen family's wrongdoings)
(The evil are not punished)

00:07:38.172 --> 00:07:39.040
(are facilitated by Prince Duan)
(The evil are not punished)

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.850
(Imperial Study)

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:11.160
The Shen family's case has closed.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.038
What's going on with these reports?

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.519
Your Majesty, please seek justice for me.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.390
These reports are all false accusations
against Prince Duan's Residence.

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:23.800
Moreover,

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:25.800
since Her Highness' tragedy...

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:27.879
What's with that?

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:29.399
Rumors in the streets

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.399
say that she used to harm
the Shen family

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.360
so she was punished.

00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:35.530
Darn it!

00:08:36.137 --> 00:08:37.559
Who dares to speak nonsense?

00:08:37.787 --> 00:08:39.490
Arrest and question them!

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.833
I don't care about the rumors!

00:08:43.112 --> 00:08:44.192
But I received news

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.039
that Xi Yan

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.800
sneaked into
the princess's bridal chamber

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.000
during her wedding.

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:54.159
What did she do?

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:56.279
She sneaked inside.

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:57.200
No one knows.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.240
Only a servant who passed by

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.919
heard their conversation.

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:01.960
She said

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.480
Shen Changning was mentioned.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.120
What are you trying to say?

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.120
Just tell me.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.080
I dare not

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.799
assume before you, Your Majesty.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.559
But I'm willing to try

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:13.799
to see

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.000
if Xi Yan is Shen Changning.

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:20.080
Your Majesty.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.559
I met the Young Lady
of the Shen family.

00:09:23.072 --> 00:09:25.899
She looks completely different
from Lady Xi Yan.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.860
There has been a face-swapping technique
going around in the streets.

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:33.320
If Xi Yan isn't Shen Changning,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.720
why would she be so persistent

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.039
about the Shen family case?

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:37.159
Her Highness

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:39.279
would not be forced to death.

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:41.900
Will you know immediately

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.639
after testing?

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.120
I, Xi Yan,

00:10:02.437 --> 00:10:03.580
greet Your Majesty.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:05.357
Shen Changning,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.600
have you always been thinking

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.840
that the Shen family died

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:13.000
an aggrieved death?

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:19.639
Your Majesty,

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.679
there are many rumors in the streets

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.540
saying that I am the eldest daughter
of the Shen family, Shen Changning.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.120
I didn't expect the nonsense

00:10:27.362 --> 00:10:29.137
to disturb Your Majesty's peace.

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:32.600
I also think

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:34.200
it is ridiculous,

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:37.080
but since you appeared,

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:38.960
you've been causing problems.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.519
Today, Lord Xiao
has come up with a method

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:44.879
to prove your innocence.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.399
The Shen family's case is closed.

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:54.759
I've also allowed

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.120
for the traitors of the Shen family
to be buried.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.759
However, some people have been calling

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.559
for the case to be overturned

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:03.907
and is willing

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.720
to be in cahoots with the traitors.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.039
Since you want to prove
that you are unrelated to them,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.487
just burn

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:15.360
their bodies.

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:24.159
Bring them here.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.639
Your Majesty,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.600
you govern with benevolence

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.490
and your reputation
spreads all over the world.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.500
The Shen family has committed suicide
to atone for their crimes.

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:52.990
If they can't keep their bodies whole,

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.460
I'm worried that it might ruin
Your Majesty's reputation.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.480
Please reconsider this, Your Majesty.

00:11:59.637 --> 00:12:01.080
I don't need you

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.279
to interfere with my actions.

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:06.960
Xi Yan,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.559
do you not want to burn the bodies

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.799
or go against His Majesty's orders?

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:14.960
Why don't

00:12:15.462 --> 00:12:16.919
His Majesty's guards

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:18.240
help you instead?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.240
Don't let His Majesty misunderstand

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.279
your innocence.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.000
I'll do it myself.

00:13:13.087 --> 00:13:15.120
(End of Episode)

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.840
Lord Pei,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.919
this item looks familiar.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.399
Do you recognise it?
