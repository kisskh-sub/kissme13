[Jacob] The next day
Moses said to his people,

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.771
"You have committed a great sin.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:49.026
Now I will go up to the Lord.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.945
Perhaps I can make atonement
for your sin."

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.490
So Moses returned to the Lord and said,

00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:59.119
"Oh, what a great sin
these people have committed.

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:04.124
They have made gods of gold
for themselves.

00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:07.336
False idols they worshipped.

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:12.466
Yet now, if you would
only forgive their sin."

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:18.305
[quietly] May the Lord bless his name.
In the name of Jesus.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.516
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

00:02:21.058 --> 00:02:23.310
Now and at the hour of our death, Amen.

-What are you doing here, boy?

Yes, sir.

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:47.042

You know what you got to do.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.847

Let me take some condolence
up onto those gallows.

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.651
Say it. Tell me you promise.

If you're gonna shoot a man...

00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.086

to look him in the eye.

Look at me.

Let's take these outside.

This is no place for them

Hmm?

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:49.334
When we walk out these doors,
we will attract attention.

And when I've convinced you

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:53.714
I'm not the man you came here to kill,

00:11:53.797 --> 00:11:55.340
I'd like you to
give yourself up peacefully.

All's well, thank you, Gideon.

What does it say?

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:17.714
[Henry] Saul Butler.

00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:19.842
[Gideon] What's the boy after?

00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:21.134
[horse neighs]

00:13:21.218 --> 00:13:22.219
Well...

00:13:22.845 --> 00:13:25.556
he thinks Saul wronged him in some way.

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:26.974
[Gideon] Must be mistaken.

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:29.059
Saul never wronged anyone.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:31.562
Obviously, he's been misinformed.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:36.859
If you want to shoot bullets
at the headstone

00:13:36.942 --> 00:13:38.402
for the sheer poetry of it all...

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:40.904
I won't stop you.

00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:43.407

[Gabriel grunts]

00:13:58.463 --> 00:13:59.506
Hmm.

00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:01.592
What's your beef with Butler?

00:14:03.719 --> 00:14:05.012
He framed my father.

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.097
Sent him to the gallows.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:08.765
[Gabriel] Hmm.

00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:10.893
Did he now?

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:13.604
All right, everyone.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:16.690
Back to business. We're all through here.

00:14:17.274 --> 00:14:19.193
Go on now. It's all good here.

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:23.572
-It's all good.
-[horse neighing]

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:28.827
-[indistinct chatter]
-Are you arresting me?

00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:30.579
For wanting to shoot me in the back?

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:33.332
I'd have to arrest half the town.

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:35.209
In here.

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:40.047
Sam, a whiskey for my young friend here
and a coffee for me.

00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:43.884
Um, about that whiskey, Sheriff,

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:45.886
-I don't actually drink.
-[Gabriel] Take a seat.

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:49.014
Take a seat.

00:14:54.186 --> 00:14:55.687
He's with me, Chuck.

00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:01.068
Henry Broadway.

00:15:01.151 --> 00:15:03.111
That would make your father
Isaac Broadway.

00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:07.741
-You know him?
-No. He built half this town.

00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:10.369
Everyone knows the name Isaac Broadway.

00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:11.703
You didn't know?

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:15.707
I didn't see him after he went to prison,
after my mama died.

00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:16.875
[Gabriel] Hmm.

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.670
Uh, let me give you a bit of advice.

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:23.006
Keep your ancestry between us.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:27.052
-Not every man who's known is loved.
-[door opens]

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.762
-[footsteps approaching]
-People don't like him?

00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:30.430
[Gabriel] Well...

00:15:30.931 --> 00:15:32.015
[Gideon] Morning, Sam.

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:33.934
Every town has its heroes and villains.

00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:38.230
-[Gideon] Two of your finest.
-In this town, Saul Butler was the hero

00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:40.315
and Isaac Broadway was the villain.

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:43.485
Now Butler's dead.

00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:49.032
You being Broadway's son, I wouldn't
want anyone to get a lust for vengeance.

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:50.284
How did he die?

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.785
They think it was a Blackfoot girl.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.330
-[Henry] Was it?
-I don't believe it was.

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.086
You came here to kill the Sheriff.

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:03.380
What was your plan after that?

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:04.882
[Henry] I didn't really have a plan.

00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:07.217
I spent all I had just trying to get here.

00:16:09.303 --> 00:16:10.679
Sam, do me a favor.

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.931
Feed this young boy
and give him a room for the night.

00:16:13.015 --> 00:16:14.474
Long as you're paying.

00:16:18.187 --> 00:16:21.607
In the morning,
I want you to get in that coach

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:24.526
and get as far away
from this town as you can.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.486
I'm sorry for trying to kill you.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.030
You could have been a hero.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.116
[Gabriel] Like I said...

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:33.744
heroes and villains.

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.747
Don't get caught
on the wrong side of that coin.

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:39.833
[low indistinct chatter]

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.713
-[woman] Gabriel.
-[Gabriel] Hello.

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:48.258
[chuckles] She came to say
Rachel's not feeling well.

00:16:48.342 --> 00:16:49.426
[Gabriel] Oh.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.594
Ah.

00:16:51.136 --> 00:16:52.638
Good girl, Mabel.

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:55.557
Taking care of Rachel.
Let me see what I've got here.

00:16:57.184 --> 00:16:58.393
-Okay.
-[Mabel gasps] Candy.

00:16:58.477 --> 00:17:00.979
There you go. That's for you.
Don't tell anyone I gave you sweets.

00:17:01.063 --> 00:17:02.147
-Thank you.
-[Gabriel] Good girl.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.484
I'm worried for you. People are riled up.

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:09.029
Don't worry.
I'm still faster than they are.

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.114
Go see Rachel now.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:12.782
Go.

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.492
[kisses] Love you.

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:17.246
-Go. Bye-bye now, Mabel.

-I know you're there, Gideon.
-Gabriel, just a word.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:34.346
I just want to know what you're gonna do

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:36.181
about that murdering Indian girl.

00:17:36.265 --> 00:17:37.558
Well, first...

00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:39.560
There's no evidence that Running Cub,

00:17:39.643 --> 00:17:42.563
a Blackfoot girl, not an Injun,
actually killed Saul Butler.

00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:45.274
-See, I believe there is.
-Well, leaving that aside...

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.317
she's gone.

00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:49.820
Even if I wanted to hand her
over to you for a lynching,

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:53.907
it's a basic challenge
to arrest a person who's not there.

00:17:53.991 --> 00:17:57.744
Aye, see,
there's a fur trapper from up north,

00:17:57.828 --> 00:18:00.789
and he claims that he saw
someone that looks like her

00:18:00.873 --> 00:18:02.624
up by Strawberry Creek.

00:18:02.708 --> 00:18:03.792
Uh-huh.

00:18:04.418 --> 00:18:07.963
By "looks like her,"
do you mean a Blackfoot?

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:10.382
Hmm? There are several thousand of them.

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:12.009
Maybe you should just deputize me,

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.510
seeing you can't find anyone.

00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:15.012
I'll look into it.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:18.265
I will. Thank you for your civic duty.

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:20.517
Piece of shit.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.815
It's probably just a bad meal.

00:18:26.899 --> 00:18:28.817
[soft piano music playing]

00:18:28.901 --> 00:18:31.153
But it's near time. Keep off your feet.

And your back.

Can you handle her clientele
on top of yours?

On top?

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:40.287
You mean stacked up
like a pile of pancakes?

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.081
-What am I supposed to do?
-Rest.

00:18:43.165 --> 00:18:45.751
I know one man who's not
gonna let her rest.

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:47.461

Hi, sweetie. You did real good
bringing Miss Sarah.

Okay.

Where'd you get that candy?

00:19:03.936 --> 00:19:05.562

Yeah. Yeah.

Gideon fought with Saul in the war.

Fair enough.

Well, Henry...

after all your travels.

Don't you think?

00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:54.648
Yeah, I... I plan on resting.

I don't want no trouble, mister.

00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:18.023
-[Asa] Hmm.
-[Julia] It's an urn, Asa.

00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:20.526
For someone who died,
don't be so mean about it.

00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:22.903
It's my pa.

00:23:25.989 --> 00:23:28.158
You brought your dead daddy here
for a drink, hmm?

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:30.494
-Answer me, boy.
-Yeah.

00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:33.789
Let's buy him a round!

00:23:33.872 --> 00:23:35.666
-[crowd laughing]
-[Austin whoops]

00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:37.292
Come on, sweetie, let's get out of here.

00:23:37.376 --> 00:23:38.585
Get your things.

00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:39.753
[Asa] Hey, Julia...

00:23:40.754 --> 00:23:42.881
tell Rachel to get her ass over here.

00:23:43.465 --> 00:23:45.592
She ain't working
till that baby comes, Asa.

00:23:46.552 --> 00:23:48.220
[Asa] Then you can take her place.

00:23:49.304 --> 00:23:51.306
You'll wait your turn
just like everybody else.

00:23:52.516 --> 00:23:54.434
[Asa] Don't take too long, little boy.

00:23:56.562 --> 00:23:58.564
-I know you won't.
-[Austin chuckles]

00:24:00.524 --> 00:24:02.651
-Hmm. Thank you.
-Hmm.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.238
-[horse snorts]
-You know why I can't leave.

00:24:07.948 --> 00:24:09.575
You know the truth.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.369
What happened to my mother and my father.

00:24:14.162 --> 00:24:15.998
You know Butler killed them.

00:24:17.249 --> 00:24:18.709
[Gabriel] He's dead.

00:24:19.418 --> 00:24:21.837
Staying here and dying
won't bring justice.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.589
[fire crackling]

00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:27.092
The truth can't die
with those who carry secrets.

00:24:29.386 --> 00:24:32.097
Someone has to be there to tell it.

00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:37.227
When you left your place...

00:24:40.647 --> 00:24:42.065
were you still you?

00:24:45.152 --> 00:24:46.445
When I left Ireland...

00:24:47.863 --> 00:24:49.489
I meant to leave it behind.

00:24:50.365 --> 00:24:51.575
Did you?

00:24:51.658 --> 00:24:52.743
No.

00:24:53.243 --> 00:24:54.536
Not all of it.

00:24:55.829 --> 00:24:58.040
I still had the heartbeat of who I was...

00:24:58.582 --> 00:24:59.666
where I came from.

00:25:03.045 --> 00:25:04.546
The memories...

00:25:05.881 --> 00:25:07.883
of the sorrows of my youth.

00:25:07.966 --> 00:25:09.801
[fire continues crackling]

[soft music playing]

00:25:16.892 --> 00:25:19.728
[Julia] You ain't gonna tell me
you've never been with a girl, right?

00:25:19.811 --> 00:25:23.148
Um, I've never really had the time.

00:25:23.232 --> 00:25:25.859
[chuckles] Well, most men
take no time at all.

00:25:28.445 --> 00:25:29.655
Hey, look at me.

00:25:31.114 --> 00:25:32.324
Give me your hand.

00:25:35.744 --> 00:25:38.121
I'm just gonna make you feel good, okay?

00:25:39.414 --> 00:25:41.250
See? Doesn't that feel good?

00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:44.878
-Yeah.
-It's gonna be okay.

00:25:46.588 --> 00:25:50.008
You're gonna have to let go
for just a second. [chuckles]

00:25:57.182 --> 00:25:59.101
You can kiss me if you'd like.

-[Asa] C'mon in there!

-I ain't got all fuckin' night!
-Shut up, Asa.

00:26:05.649 --> 00:26:07.734
You'll have your turn when it's your turn.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.490

[Julia] Let me take care of this.

00:26:20.038 --> 00:26:22.916
-[banging on door]
-Stop banging on my damn door!

00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:27.296
Go back downstairs
and wait for your goddamn turn!

00:26:29.423 --> 00:26:30.841
My turn.

00:26:32.092 --> 00:26:34.261
Get out! Now!

00:26:34.344 --> 00:26:36.054
You gonna point that at me?

00:26:36.138 --> 00:26:38.557
Oh, I'm gonna do a lot more than point
if you don't leave right now.

Is the Sheriff there?
He needs to come to town now.

00:29:59.383 --> 00:30:01.760
There's been a shooting. There's two dead.

00:30:02.261 --> 00:30:05.639
That miner named Asa
and Julia from the saloon.

-Is Rachel all right?
-She's shook up. Everybody is.

No.

with that, Sarah.

You're the deputy?

00:30:43.177 --> 00:30:45.095
Is this what this town has for the law?

we'd have someone dangling by now.

I'm not here for the dead.

I'm here for who's living.

for when the Sheriff gets here.

[Rachel sobs] What am I supposed to do?

00:31:09.203 --> 00:31:11.038

[Henry panting]

00:32:22.943 --> 00:32:26.363
[Christopher] You sure got friendly
with that sheriff awful fast.

00:32:27.865 --> 00:32:30.158
Thought you said he framed your daddy.

00:32:30.284 --> 00:32:32.077
[laughs]

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.996
It was the wrong sheriff.

Well, now you on the run.

00:32:39.001 --> 00:32:40.669
I think it was God...

punishing me for trying to be
with that woman.

[Christopher laughing]

00:32:46.508 --> 00:32:48.594
Some might say it's a sin

00:32:48.677 --> 00:32:50.846
not to be with a woman when she calls.

00:32:50.929 --> 00:32:53.432
That sounds like something
your daddy would say.

00:32:53.515 --> 00:32:55.976
And what would you know
about my father? [panting]

00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:59.396
[Christopher] Oh, I knowed
your daddy real, real well.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.190
Before the war,

00:33:01.857 --> 00:33:06.612
I was gainfully unemployed
on a plantation owned by

00:33:06.695 --> 00:33:08.322
an old banker in Savannah.

00:33:08.405 --> 00:33:11.116
I met your daddy when
the Union Army come through,

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.618
burning up everything.

00:33:13.869 --> 00:33:16.079
I knew where some gold was hid,

00:33:16.163 --> 00:33:18.081
and I told your daddy about it.

00:33:18.665 --> 00:33:20.501
Me and him stole enough gold...

00:33:21.418 --> 00:33:23.754
to pave the streets of Heaven. [chuckles]

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.633
Hell, we planned to go out west with this

00:33:27.716 --> 00:33:29.885
Blackfoot couple as our guide.

00:33:31.094 --> 00:33:32.095
[Henry exhales sharply]

00:33:32.179 --> 00:33:33.472
That's right, Henry...

00:33:34.139 --> 00:33:36.308
that same Blackfoot couple

00:33:36.391 --> 00:33:38.352
they hanged your daddy for killing.

00:33:39.811 --> 00:33:41.939
But he pulled a fast one on me.

00:33:43.857 --> 00:33:46.944
He negotiated with some paddy rollers

00:33:47.653 --> 00:33:49.571
for the rights to my person.

00:33:50.572 --> 00:33:51.865
He sold you?

00:33:51.949 --> 00:33:53.534
Yeah, the war was still on,

00:33:53.617 --> 00:33:56.245
people were still buying
and selling slaves.

00:33:57.746 --> 00:34:01.166
So I guess he didn't see
nothing wrong with selling my Black ass

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.253
to make a little extra
and keeping my share.

00:34:04.378 --> 00:34:05.420
[Henry grunts]

00:34:06.046 --> 00:34:07.548
You're here for that gold?

00:34:09.049 --> 00:34:11.260
Been looking for it since the war ended.

00:34:11.385 --> 00:34:14.679
[grunts] I told you my pa was framed.

00:34:15.264 --> 00:34:17.099
Sheriff Saul Butler...

00:34:18.391 --> 00:34:20.518
used to be a lawman in Savannah.

00:34:21.645 --> 00:34:25.983
I used to hear stories
about him moving out here somewhere to

00:34:26.065 --> 00:34:27.818
a place called Trinity,

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.902
looking for that old banker's gold.

00:34:29.987 --> 00:34:33.657
So maybe he probably had
a good reason to frame your daddy...

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.574
you think?

00:34:34.658 --> 00:34:37.159
You think I know where that gold is?

00:34:37.244 --> 00:34:40.080
I don't know. Do you?

00:34:41.831 --> 00:34:42.916
No!

Hi, Sheriff.

00:34:56.847 --> 00:34:58.473
Hello, Mabel.

00:34:58.557 --> 00:35:00.058
I see you're minding her.

00:35:00.934 --> 00:35:02.352
Where were you last night?

00:35:02.936 --> 00:35:04.688
-Maybe, uh...
-Mabel?

00:35:04.771 --> 00:35:06.607
Go upstairs and start your reading.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.108
Okay. Bye, Sheriff.

00:35:08.192 --> 00:35:09.193
Good girl.

00:35:09.276 --> 00:35:10.485
I'm okay.

00:35:11.486 --> 00:35:13.113
I'm all right. I'm all right.

00:35:14.489 --> 00:35:16.241
Come sit down. Come sit down.

[Gabriel sighs wearily]

I tell you, that Gideon's
like a bag of weasels.

Shooting his mouth off, wanting to go
take a posse down to Strawberry Creek

00:35:26.251 --> 00:35:29.505
and get that Blackfoot girl
who killed Sheriff Butler.

00:35:29.588 --> 00:35:32.007
I... I just figured
I'd better go out there

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.175
before there was any bloodshed.

00:35:33.258 --> 00:35:36.303
While you were gone,
three people were killed in town.

00:35:36.386 --> 00:35:39.598
-Who?
-[Sarah] Asa and Red Benton and...

00:35:42.017 --> 00:35:43.352
and her mama.

00:35:45.103 --> 00:35:46.104
I'm sorry.

00:35:46.688 --> 00:35:47.648
I am sorry.

00:35:48.398 --> 00:35:50.651
I told them to leave everything as it was.

00:35:51.777 --> 00:35:52.861
It's good.

00:35:53.487 --> 00:35:54.404
It's very good.

Where were you?

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.267
I won't ask you again, Sam.

00:36:24.977 --> 00:36:26.270
Red's dead.

00:36:26.353 --> 00:36:27.688
Uh-huh.

00:36:30.858 --> 00:36:32.067

rest till they make him bleed.

-Who?
-The kid.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.057
When he shot 'em both.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.976
I don't know. Enlighten me.
You're the sheriff.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.270
[chuckles] That's funny, Gideon.

00:37:51.021 --> 00:37:53.982
Because I swear to God, every day
you're telling me how to do my job.

00:37:54.066 --> 00:37:55.400
I just want to see some justice.

00:37:55.484 --> 00:37:57.319
Justice needs to be based on the truth.

00:37:57.402 --> 00:37:59.404
What you want is not justice.

00:37:59.947 --> 00:38:01.615
It's blood.

Right.

00:38:12.501 --> 00:38:16.004
And there's no goddamn Indian girl
out by Strawberry Creek.

00:38:16.088 --> 00:38:17.214

I'd like you to meet
Isaac Broadway's son, Henry.

What's he doing here?

00:39:31.997 --> 00:39:36.585
Uh, Jacob is a respected stage actor.

00:39:36.668 --> 00:39:38.295
Or so I'm told.

00:39:39.254 --> 00:39:43.800
I engaged his services
to get a confession out your daddy.

00:39:43.884 --> 00:39:46.720
But your father would not
release his tongue, young man.

00:39:48.639 --> 00:39:51.850
Though I didn't catch
what he whispered to you at the end there.

[chuckles] Ain't that right, fellas?

00:40:09.243 --> 00:40:10.827
We had an arrangement.

00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:12.496
And I plan to stick to it.

00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:14.957
Just call it divine inspiration.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.002
Well, y'all can divinely pass
the collection plate amongst yourself.

00:40:19.086 --> 00:40:21.421
Because I ain't giving up
none of my share.

00:40:24.633 --> 00:40:26.343
All right, y'all. I'm going to hie.

00:40:26.426 --> 00:40:28.053
[Jacob] Don't harm the kid.

00:40:28.595 --> 00:40:30.848
Go ahead. He'll be along in a minute.

00:40:32.099 --> 00:40:34.726
-Who'll be along?
-Sheriff.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.437
We left a pretty clear path
for him to follow.

00:40:37.521 --> 00:40:40.107
In case it ain't obvious to you, Henry,

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:44.570
I'm offering you a opportunity
to make a life for yourself.

00:40:44.653 --> 00:40:47.698
To make good on where your daddy failed.

00:40:47.781 --> 00:40:51.368
If you help me find that gold,
you can keep his share.

00:40:51.869 --> 00:40:54.079
It would have been
your inheritance anyway.

00:40:55.163 --> 00:40:56.665
Why would you want to share it?

00:40:56.748 --> 00:41:00.669
I ain't the Devil, son.
[chuckling] I'm just a sinner.

00:41:00.752 --> 00:41:04.006
We had always planned
to settle down somewhere

00:41:04.089 --> 00:41:06.216
and bury the gold. Keep it safe.

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.386
Mm, dig up some every now and then
when we needed it.

00:41:11.597 --> 00:41:14.016

Well, I hope to hell it comes
to you soon, because I believe

00:41:21.773 --> 00:41:23.942
that's where your daddy buried that gold

00:41:24.026 --> 00:41:25.819
and he built the house on top of it.

00:41:27.738 --> 00:41:30.157

You go to the barn.

00:46:28.455 --> 00:46:29.748
I'll be over shortly.

Ah, that young fella

00:46:55.691 --> 00:46:58.652
who came into town
stirring everything up... [chuckles]

00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:01.530
He's Isaac Broadway's son.

00:47:01.613 --> 00:47:03.699
-[Sarah] Little Henry.
-[Gabriel] Aye, you knew him?

00:47:03.782 --> 00:47:06.243
I brought him into this world
right over there.

00:47:06.326 --> 00:47:07.327
What?

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.204
He's a murderer?

00:47:09.288 --> 00:47:10.998
No, no, no. He's not a murderer.

00:47:11.748 --> 00:47:13.667
I don't know what he is,
but he's not that.

00:47:14.293 --> 00:47:16.837
Listen, I'm gonna put the rifle
by the door, okay?

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.797
Someone comes along who you don't know,

00:47:18.881 --> 00:47:20.174
even if it's a man of God,

00:47:20.257 --> 00:47:22.885
especially if it's a man of God,
costume and all,

00:47:22.968 --> 00:47:26.180
soon as he opens his mouth, you shoot him.

00:47:27.014 --> 00:47:28.891
-You hear me?
-Costume?

00:47:28.974 --> 00:47:30.392
Aye.

00:47:30.475 --> 00:47:32.769
Evil's wearing all kinds of things
these days.

You know... [sighs]

00:48:19.816 --> 00:48:22.444
When I came out here,
all I wanted was to make him proud.

00:48:23.904 --> 00:48:25.739
My ma used to talk about him.

00:48:27.407 --> 00:48:29.034
He was innocent.

00:48:30.369 --> 00:48:31.578
He was a good man.

00:48:32.996 --> 00:48:35.749
[sighs] He loved us.

00:48:35.832 --> 00:48:37.042
[Gabriel] Hmm.

00:48:38.794 --> 00:48:41.839
Turns out the only thing
he ever cared about was a pile of gold.

00:48:42.381 --> 00:48:43.966
[scoffs] Gold?

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:46.218
-[sighs]
-[Henry] Yeah.

00:48:46.844 --> 00:48:48.762
He stole it from the south.

00:48:49.847 --> 00:48:51.098
Huge pile of it.

00:48:51.682 --> 00:48:53.559
Then he came here with the Indians.

00:48:54.268 --> 00:48:55.936
Yeah, I'm sure he cared for you.

00:48:56.019 --> 00:48:57.145
[Henry] Bullshit.

00:48:58.272 --> 00:48:59.439
[sighs]

00:49:01.233 --> 00:49:02.860
I know it's bullshit.

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:07.906
Because if he loved us,
he would have told my ma about it.

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:09.992
[melancholy music playing]

00:49:10.075 --> 00:49:11.493
Huge pile of gold?

00:49:12.786 --> 00:49:15.414
Could have changed our lives.
Could have saved her life.

[exhales]

00:49:17.749 --> 00:49:20.794
And it's sitting under
the house he built this entire time.

00:49:24.298 --> 00:49:25.382
Henry...

00:49:27.551 --> 00:49:29.178
This was your father's house.

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:33.640
You were born here.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.018
I thought this was yours.

00:49:36.101 --> 00:49:37.769
[Gabriel] Actually,
it belongs to the town.

00:49:37.853 --> 00:49:40.063
Saul Butler made sure of that.

00:49:41.064 --> 00:49:44.318
Hmm. Jesus, he tore it down
and built it so many times,

00:49:44.401 --> 00:49:45.485
we all thought he was crazy.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.739
He must have been looking for the gold.

00:49:48.822 --> 00:49:51.074
And that's why he killed her parents.

00:49:51.867 --> 00:49:53.076
He must have...

00:49:54.328 --> 00:49:55.913
-Well...
-What?

00:49:55.996 --> 00:49:57.206

How many of those men are still alive?

00:50:03.462 --> 00:50:05.339
[sighs] Just the one.

Former slave, stole the gold with my pa.

00:50:08.926 --> 00:50:11.136
-Now he wants it back.
-[Gabriel] Right.

00:50:18.644 --> 00:50:20.145
You killed one of those men.

What happened to you, little lady?

00:50:56.014 --> 00:50:57.015
It's nothing.

00:50:58.058 --> 00:51:00.435

If that's my sister,
she's bruised up like that,

I might want to find out who did that.

00:51:12.614 --> 00:51:14.449

Ah! [inhales deeply]

[exhales] Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:51:30.424 --> 00:51:33.260
I use that term lightly.

00:51:33.343 --> 00:51:34.970
I bet you all wondering...

00:51:35.512 --> 00:51:37.431
what a handsome devil like myself

00:51:37.514 --> 00:51:39.433
with a distinctly different complexion,

00:51:39.516 --> 00:51:43.604
is doing wandering into your
humble establishment.

But if you look past my negritude,

00:51:46.982 --> 00:51:50.485
you will find
that we ain't that different.

00:51:51.528 --> 00:51:52.613
Where are you from?

00:51:53.572 --> 00:51:55.866
-Georgia, sir. You?
-Georgia.

00:51:55.949 --> 00:52:00.329
[laughs] I knew I felt something familiar.

00:52:02.122 --> 00:52:04.291
Are you just trying
to get yourself killed?

00:52:04.374 --> 00:52:06.502
Well, sir, now, if you went and did that,

00:52:06.585 --> 00:52:09.463
you might not find out
where that little Blackfoot girl

00:52:09.546 --> 00:52:11.965
you've been running off
at the mouth about is hiding.

00:52:12.966 --> 00:52:15.093
And you do want to know where she is...

00:52:15.177 --> 00:52:16.178
don't you?

00:52:17.095 --> 00:52:18.514
If you know where she is...

00:52:19.223 --> 00:52:20.641
I think you're going to tell me.

Maybe.

Ah, I see.

and do your job for you.

00:53:33.922 --> 00:53:36.425
Yeah, don't let me keep you.
Go and catch up with them boys.

And make sure they bring
that girl back proper and in one piece.

Her son, my grandbaby... [chuckles]

00:56:29.389 --> 00:56:34.811
Oh, that is the most angelic child
you ever laid eyes on.

00:56:36.438 --> 00:56:38.732
[sighs] You... You have children?

00:56:40.359 --> 00:56:41.360
No.

00:56:41.985 --> 00:56:43.612
[Christopher] Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm.

00:56:44.404 --> 00:56:46.990
Whoo, Lord. [groans] You mind if I...

00:56:47.824 --> 00:56:49.618
[exhales] ...sit for a spell,
take a load off?

00:56:49.743 --> 00:56:50.953
-Of course.
-[Christopher] Hmm.

00:56:51.828 --> 00:56:53.830
Whoo, Lord. [groans]

I'm fixing supper.

00:57:21.525 --> 00:57:23.110
No, go right ahead.

00:57:24.236 --> 00:57:25.737
I'm Sarah...

00:57:25.821 --> 00:57:27.239
Sarah Dove.

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:29.992
Maiden name, Creuzburg.

00:57:30.075 --> 00:57:31.285
[Christopher] Oh.

00:57:31.368 --> 00:57:34.788
Always make sure to tell people that,
in case they know my kin.

00:57:35.414 --> 00:57:38.208
Hmm. I'm, uh, Christopher, ma'am.

00:57:38.792 --> 00:57:41.086
Uh. But most folk call me St. Christopher.

00:57:42.963 --> 00:57:44.464
My husband's the sheriff of this town.

00:57:45.382 --> 00:57:46.341
That right?

00:57:48.385 --> 00:57:50.220
I don't imagine you've seen a boy

00:57:50.304 --> 00:57:52.181
running around here, have you?

00:57:53.515 --> 00:57:54.933
Name Henry Broadway?

00:57:55.601 --> 00:57:58.645
Uh, he's in a bit of trouble.
I'm trying to help him out.

00:57:59.897 --> 00:58:02.733
You know Henry Broadway?

00:58:03.358 --> 00:58:05.360
-Yeah, you?
-Uh...

00:58:06.195 --> 00:58:07.821
Yeah, I did...

00:58:08.822 --> 00:58:09.823
when he was young.

00:58:12.576 --> 00:58:15.329
Do you mind if I have
another cup of water, please?

00:58:19.541 --> 00:58:20.626
Sure.

00:58:22.878 --> 00:58:23.962
Thank you.

00:58:24.046 --> 00:58:27.216
You're a good woman, Miss Dove.
The name suits you.

00:58:27.299 --> 00:58:28.800
Well, Henry, um...

00:58:29.635 --> 00:58:32.262
used to talk a lot about the house
that his daddy built.

00:58:34.473 --> 00:58:36.850
Think it made him feel young and innocent

00:58:36.934 --> 00:58:39.061
before he got in all this trouble.

00:58:39.144 --> 00:58:41.230
[suspenseful music playing]

00:58:41.313 --> 00:58:44.691
You wouldn't, um, happen to know where
that house is, would you?

00:58:44.775 --> 00:58:46.902
I think that's where he's hiding.

00:58:49.112 --> 00:58:50.405
Miss Dove?

00:58:51.949 --> 00:58:52.991
No.

00:58:53.909 --> 00:58:57.287
No, you don't know where this house is?

00:58:58.622 --> 00:59:00.249
You know him when he was a boy,

00:59:00.332 --> 00:59:03.544
but you don't know where he lived.

00:59:08.715 --> 00:59:09.800
Miss Dove?

00:59:11.969 --> 00:59:13.053
You all right?

00:59:13.136 --> 00:59:16.473
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'm just, uh, thinking.

00:59:16.557 --> 00:59:20.060
You seem a little flustered.
I didn't mean to upset you.

00:59:20.143 --> 00:59:21.979
[suspenseful music continues]

00:59:24.231 --> 00:59:26.358
-It's this house.
-This house?

00:59:26.441 --> 00:59:27.484
I haven't seen him.

00:59:27.568 --> 00:59:29.069
He's probably hiding out somewhere,

00:59:29.152 --> 00:59:31.572
-in the forest, perhaps.
-[laughs]

00:59:32.281 --> 00:59:33.365

00:59:34.741 --> 00:59:36.577
How does you and your husband...

00:59:38.453 --> 00:59:40.289
happen to live in this place?

00:59:41.999 --> 00:59:43.417
It belongs to the town.

00:59:44.293 --> 00:59:46.712
We live here because he's the sheriff.

00:59:46.795 --> 00:59:48.297

Mayhap you might want
to send her outdoor to play.

Because I killed him.

I said, who has my back?

01:07:45.566 --> 01:07:47.651
[crowd] Yeah. [cheering]

01:07:47.734 --> 01:07:50.153
-[gunshot]
-[Gideon] Do you have my back?

01:07:51.029 --> 01:07:52.531
-[Gideon] Justice!
-[gunshot]

01:07:53.073 --> 01:07:55.075
Well, my friends.

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:57.911
Did I guide you right,
or I guide you wrong? Was she there?

01:07:57.995 --> 01:07:59.329
[Gideon] Aye.

01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:00.831
[Christopher] Did you kill her?

01:08:00.914 --> 01:08:04.918
My son is dead, but she ain't yet.

01:08:05.002 --> 01:08:06.420
Killed your boy?

01:08:08.547 --> 01:08:09.965
Hmm, condolences.

01:08:11.258 --> 01:08:12.467
Let me tell y'all a story.

01:08:13.427 --> 01:08:16.220
You remember that boy
come through here about two days ago?

01:08:17.346 --> 01:08:20.475
You know who his daddy is? Or was?

01:08:20.559 --> 01:08:21.685
[suspenseful music playing]

01:08:21.768 --> 01:08:23.270
What do you mean, who he had in that urn?

01:08:23.353 --> 01:08:24.938
[Christopher] Mm-hmm.

01:08:25.022 --> 01:08:28.024
Isaac Broadway was in that urn.

01:08:28.609 --> 01:08:31.737
And he sent the boy here
to kill Sheriff Butler.

01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:32.988
But that ain't all.

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:37.910
Isaac Broadway stole a shitload of gold

01:08:37.993 --> 01:08:40.245
when he was a soldier down in Georgia.

01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:43.749
Now, I know this, because I helped him.

01:08:44.499 --> 01:08:47.127
It's a crime I confess to,

01:08:47.211 --> 01:08:49.837
have atoned for, and have been forgiven.

01:08:49.921 --> 01:08:51.756
But Isaac Broadway...

01:08:52.466 --> 01:08:54.091
ain't never confessed.

01:08:54.176 --> 01:08:55.676
He just hid that gold.

01:08:56.678 --> 01:08:59.055
Now, where would someone find this gold?

01:08:59.139 --> 01:09:02.267
In his house. Same house
Sheriff Butler lived in.

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:05.062
And the same one
y'all done give to the new sheriff.

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:07.981
Now, I bet anything I own

01:09:08.941 --> 01:09:11.068
that Henry Broadway is there,

01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:14.904
so is the sheriff and that Injun girl.

01:09:15.488 --> 01:09:16.865
[chair clatters]

01:09:16.948 --> 01:09:18.283
What are we waiting for?

01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:21.286
Henry Broadway, he killed my brothers.

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:22.996
He killed my brothers!

01:09:23.705 --> 01:09:26.166
Son of the bitch should be
hanging from a goddamn tree!

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:29.086
-[people murmuring]
-Let me buy you a drink.

01:09:30.127 --> 01:09:31.421
Dedicate it to your boy.

01:09:32.421 --> 01:09:34.049
Hell, matter of fact...

01:09:35.133 --> 01:09:36.760
[coins clattering]

01:09:36.844 --> 01:09:38.761

Relax. Good.

01:09:56.655 --> 01:09:57.614
You're fine.

01:09:58.782 --> 01:09:59.867
You're safe.

01:10:00.409 --> 01:10:01.827
You're safe.

01:10:05.163 --> 01:10:06.164

[Sarah] You'll be fine. Good girl.

01:10:09.585 --> 01:10:10.794
You're doing great.

01:10:11.503 --> 01:10:13.547
[suspenseful music playing]

01:10:18.343 --> 01:10:19.386
[Gabriel] Sarah...

01:10:20.929 --> 01:10:22.764
men are coming here soon.

01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:23.765
Trying to kill me.

01:10:25.225 --> 01:10:26.310
What happened?

01:10:27.686 --> 01:10:28.812
I killed Saul.

01:10:29.605 --> 01:10:31.481
Now, we have not much time.

01:10:31.565 --> 01:10:33.192
When you're ready,

01:10:33.275 --> 01:10:35.944
I want you to grab that bag over there
that I've packed for you.

01:10:36.028 --> 01:10:38.947
I want you to take Mabel,
and I want you to leave with Henry.

01:10:39.031 --> 01:10:40.115
What? No.

01:10:40.199 --> 01:10:42.117
I'm gonna die tonight, Sarah.

01:10:42.201 --> 01:10:43.827
And I want you to live.

01:10:44.536 --> 01:10:47.372
-No.
-Take care of Mabel.

-[somber music playing]
-[Gabriel] Hmm?

01:10:49.291 --> 01:10:53.295
[chuckles] You wanted a child,
and I couldn't give you one.

01:10:54.379 --> 01:10:57.799
But this is your chance.
This is your chance, darling.

01:10:59.092 --> 01:11:01.720
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:11:04.223 --> 01:11:06.058
I'm never gonna leave you.

01:11:06.725 --> 01:11:08.477
-Sarah.
-No.

01:11:08.977 --> 01:11:10.020
Never.

Broadway really buried gold
under that old house?

Yep. [sighs]

01:12:08.412 --> 01:12:11.665
It figures. The way this town
sprang up while he was here.

01:12:14.042 --> 01:12:15.460
He built this saloon.

01:12:16.128 --> 01:12:17.171
That right?

01:12:18.755 --> 01:12:20.757
[Sam] Livery stables. The town jail.

01:12:22.092 --> 01:12:23.385
Every town needs one.

01:12:24.136 --> 01:12:25.220
The church.

Isaac Broadway built this church.

[laughing]

01:22:21.275 --> 01:22:23.694
If that son of a bitch was a Christian,

01:22:23.777 --> 01:22:26.321
they'd need to tear down
every church there is

01:22:26.405 --> 01:22:29.032
and re-consecrate the ground
they's built on.

01:22:32.452 --> 01:22:35.873
The sins of the father visit the son.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.209
You betrayed me.

You the second Broadway
to put me back in chains.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.552
I thought we had agreement...

01:22:49.928 --> 01:22:52.181
that you'd still kill him.

01:22:53.223 --> 01:22:54.433
We'd split the gold.

01:22:55.601 --> 01:22:57.436
Well, you can kill me and...

01:22:58.729 --> 01:23:00.480

or you won't even reach it.

I promise you.

You take your share and you leave.

We'll take my father's share
and we'll put it back in the town.

[chuckles] What?

01:23:31.845 --> 01:23:33.514

it was about the gold, but...
