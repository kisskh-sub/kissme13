WEBVTT

00:00:01.445 --> 00:00:02.815
Eun Oh, you dropped this...

00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:18.395
What? Dad!

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:21.495
Dad?

00:00:22.165 --> 00:00:25.005
- Mr. Early, you're his dad? - What?

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:28.075
Wait, "Mr. Early?"

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:32.445
What? Do you two know each other?

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:38.615
We're friends.

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:41.555
- Yes. - Friends?

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:44.785
No, wait.

00:00:45.055 --> 00:00:47.895
How do you know my dad? How did you two meet?

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:52.325
Hold on a second. How do you two know each other?

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.635
He's the CEO I'm partnering with.

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:00.435
She was my junior.

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:03.175
He was my senior in our club, too.

00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:05.075
And we're also business partners.

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:09.175
So, you two are business partners,

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:12.615
and you know each other from a college club?

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:15.485
Yes.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:21.255
No. But I did find someone I want to marry.

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:23.625
It's just a one-sided thing.

00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:26.725
One-sided? So, you have an unrequited love?

00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:29.665
You're so outgoing. Why didn't you tell her?

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:32.335
I did, and she turned me down.

00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:33.765
She's someone who...

00:01:35.335 --> 00:01:36.605
She was at my wedding.

00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:43.645
Eun Oh.

00:01:44.815 --> 00:01:47.885
How do you know my dad?

00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:50.615
No, I mean, how did you two even meet?

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.165
I was just reminded of my son who left home.

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:01.895
I'd like to think someone out there might do the same for him.

00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:03.465
When he's exhausted and struggling.

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:08.735
So that son he was talking about was Ji Hyuk.

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:11.075
How?

00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:13.875
How?

00:02:14.475 --> 00:02:16.615
But more importantly, it's freezing out.

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.345
You shouldn't be out here this long, especially after surgery, right?

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:22.685
Wait, you know about Eun Oh's surgery, too?

00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:25.025
I'm getting hungry, too.

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:26.955
- Should we get going now? - Right. Let's go.

00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:28.395
Wait, hold on a second.

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:31.325
- Take this. - Oh, right.

00:02:32.565 --> 00:02:34.565
Wait, what about me?

00:02:35.895 --> 00:02:37.765
Today was just supposed to be the two of us.

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:39.905
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Lee.

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:43.005
See you at home. Let's go.

00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:46.275
Wait!

00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:49.815
My dad and Eun Oh?

00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:53.315
There's no connection between them. How did they meet?

00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:56.215
Friends?

00:02:57.255 --> 00:03:01.225
Talk about a small world. What are the odds?

00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:03.155
Tell me about it.

00:03:05.265 --> 00:03:06.365
So, does that mean...

00:03:06.695 --> 00:03:09.035
the one you felt uncomfortable sharing the workspace with...

00:03:09.365 --> 00:03:10.665
was my son, Ji Hyuk?

00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:15.935
- Yes. - It's fine. Don't worry about it.

00:03:16.275 --> 00:03:19.345
After all, I told you about my son who ran away and broke my heart.

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:23.615
Don't you worry about that. My lips are sealed.

00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:25.085
I know.

00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:28.085
Let's see.

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:31.155
- Here, eat up. - No, you first, please.

00:03:31.215 --> 00:03:33.855
Come on, you need to eat well to recover quickly.

00:03:37.255 --> 00:03:38.265
Here you go.

00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:41.435
- Let's eat. - Thank you for the food.

00:03:46.865 --> 00:03:48.005
This is delicious.

00:03:49.135 --> 00:03:50.135
By the way...

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:54.375
I guess it's going to be hard for us to talk now. Am I right?

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:56.375
Why is that?

00:03:56.815 --> 00:03:58.945
Between us,

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:01.045
that boy, Ji Hyuk, is caught right in the middle.

00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:06.555
That's just how people are. Sometimes, it's much easier...

00:04:06.885 --> 00:04:09.925
to confide in someone who isn't tangled up in your life.

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:15.335
That's why people go to monks, priests, and pastors,

00:04:15.435 --> 00:04:17.895
or even doctors for counseling.

00:04:21.975 --> 00:04:23.735
What we have is separate from all that.

00:04:24.505 --> 00:04:27.245
Do you think you'll feel uncomfortable around me now?

00:04:27.975 --> 00:04:31.145
I'm more worried you'll be the one who feels uncomfortable.

00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:35.355
To me,

00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:38.355
you were like a gift sent from my dad.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:42.555
You remind me so much of my dad, and you even think like him.

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:44.725
So I've really come to rely on you.

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:50.095
Thank you. I appreciate you saying that.

00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:52.205
Thanks to you,

00:04:53.235 --> 00:04:57.375
I now understand young people. And the fact that...

00:04:57.635 --> 00:05:00.075
you, someone my son's age, could understand me...

00:05:00.545 --> 00:05:02.145
made me so grateful.

00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:07.345
The truth is,

00:05:08.285 --> 00:05:11.355
the CEO I used to be partners with offered me a position...

00:05:11.355 --> 00:05:13.425
as the head of design at his company.

00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:15.925
But that CEO...

00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:18.825
is the one you know.

00:05:19.865 --> 00:05:21.535
So I don't know if I should join his company...

00:05:21.795 --> 00:05:24.595
or go back to running my business like before.

00:05:25.335 --> 00:05:27.505
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

00:05:29.135 --> 00:05:31.135
As for me...

00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:35.675
I'm having a hard time finding a job with my electrician certification.

00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:39.345
So I was wondering if maybe on one of your design sites,

00:05:40.245 --> 00:05:44.685
I could do steady work as a laborer. That's what I was going to ask.

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:48.955
A laborer? But...

00:05:49.395 --> 00:05:51.795
Ji Hyuk is doing so well, isn't he?

00:05:51.895 --> 00:05:55.265
Come on. That's a company he took over with investor money.

00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:57.235
He's just the CEO in name.

00:05:57.535 --> 00:06:00.535
He has to work like a dog to get that company off the ground.

00:06:00.965 --> 00:06:02.135
Anyway,

00:06:02.435 --> 00:06:05.905
can parents just live off their successful kids these days?

00:06:06.605 --> 00:06:07.605
Everyone has to make their own way.

00:06:10.915 --> 00:06:12.045
My mom's the same.

00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:15.385
She's determined to pay me back for helping her open the business.

00:06:16.855 --> 00:06:18.485
Right, I forgot to ask you something.

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:20.585
How did you end up having surgery?

00:06:23.855 --> 00:06:27.795
An unbelievable thing happened to me.

00:06:38.005 --> 00:06:40.575
- What's taking them so long? - That was a great meal!

00:06:40.675 --> 00:06:42.245
I'm stuffed.

00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:46.315
Oh, boy. You should take a taxi. I'll get one for you.

00:06:46.385 --> 00:06:48.715
No, that's okay. I've been sitting all day.

00:06:48.785 --> 00:06:52.085
- I'll take the bus so I can stand. - All right, if you're sure.

00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:53.355
I'll see you again soon.

00:06:53.755 --> 00:06:54.925
Okay. Get home safe.

00:06:55.255 --> 00:06:57.395
- Take care of yourself. - I will.

00:07:04.765 --> 00:07:06.065
Come out, you punk.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:17.215
What? How did you know I was hiding, Dad?

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:21.445
The woman you have a crush on... That's her, isn't it?

00:07:24.085 --> 00:07:26.185
What? Dad, how did you know?

00:07:26.255 --> 00:07:28.825
What, you think I'm a psychic or something?

00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:31.425
When I saw you waiting for her out here in the cold,

00:07:31.425 --> 00:07:33.765
I just put two and two together.

00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:36.965
About that, Dad...

00:07:37.265 --> 00:07:40.605
Did you, by any chance, say anything to Eun Oh about me?

00:07:40.865 --> 00:07:43.075
Since we live together, I can just ride with you, right?

00:07:43.535 --> 00:07:46.145
Hey, Dad. Come on, Dad!

00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:48.315
Gosh, why are you being so annoying?

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:51.945
Why won't you just tell me? How do you even know Eun Oh?

00:07:52.045 --> 00:07:54.145
- I'm tired. - Come on, Dad.

00:07:55.755 --> 00:07:57.515
Gosh, this is driving me crazy!

00:08:02.295 --> 00:08:04.855
What's going on? Did they have another fight?

00:08:07.095 --> 00:08:09.495
That's incredible. What are the odds?

00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:13.705
It reminded me how enemies are bound to clash in tight spots.

00:08:14.365 --> 00:08:16.205
"Tight spots?" Why would you say that?

00:08:16.605 --> 00:08:20.805
You remember how our son said he found someone he wants to marry?

00:08:21.105 --> 00:08:22.675
Well, that's her.

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:25.785
My goodness, honey. Are you serious?

00:08:26.145 --> 00:08:30.015
When I told him we were friends, he got completely spooked.

00:08:31.485 --> 00:08:33.325
Is she really that special?

00:08:33.955 --> 00:08:36.495
She's wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.

00:08:36.825 --> 00:08:41.325
- My, then they should get married. - Hey, come on now.

00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:44.595
Aren't you counting your chickens before they've hatched?

00:08:45.065 --> 00:08:48.405
Remember what Ji Hyuk said before? That she was at his wedding.

00:08:49.175 --> 00:08:51.875
Gosh, that crazy kid, Ji Hyuk.

00:08:56.215 --> 00:08:58.985
No way. How can my dad and Eun Oh possibly be friends?

00:09:09.925 --> 00:09:11.195
Seong Jae's first marriage.

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:13.825
Seong Jae's father forced him to get a divorce.

00:09:13.825 --> 00:09:16.865
Seong Jae's father will never give up on him.

00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:18.665
It won't just be you.

00:09:19.165 --> 00:09:21.205
Your family will be in danger, too.

00:09:21.205 --> 00:09:22.875
Because of your relationship with him,

00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:25.075
do you want him to be disowned by his family?

00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:28.175
Was this what Ji Hyuk was talking about?

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:32.185
What do I do?

00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:35.015
What am I supposed to do?

00:09:39.355 --> 00:09:40.355
(Seong Jae)

00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:45.765
Seong Jae?

00:09:46.265 --> 00:09:47.695
Come outside. I'm right in front of your house.

00:09:48.595 --> 00:09:49.665
In front of my place?

00:09:52.365 --> 00:09:53.365
Seong Jae!

00:10:03.115 --> 00:10:04.675
Seong Jae, what are you doing here?

00:10:05.715 --> 00:10:09.115
Don't tell me he's here to break up with me.

00:10:12.525 --> 00:10:16.295
- Why aren't you wearing a jacket? - What are you doing here?

00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:19.225
Come here.

00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:25.765
I have my father's permission. Now, even Ji Hyuk can't object.

00:10:27.035 --> 00:10:28.035
Really?

00:10:28.575 --> 00:10:30.675
Is your father okay with us seeing each other?

00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:32.175
Yes!

00:10:34.775 --> 00:10:36.315
What about your mother?

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:39.545
If my dad says it's okay,

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:42.455
no one can change his mind.

00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:45.855
- We can really be together now? - Yes.

00:10:45.925 --> 00:10:47.955
You should have called me first, then.

00:10:48.555 --> 00:10:50.595
I wanted to tell you in person.

00:10:51.895 --> 00:10:53.425
You've been worried sick, haven't you?

00:10:54.965 --> 00:10:56.335
I was on pins and needles.

00:10:57.195 --> 00:10:58.665
I bet you haven't been eating properly either.

00:10:59.205 --> 00:11:00.705
Do you want to go get something good to eat?

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:02.435
This late at night?

00:11:03.335 --> 00:11:04.435
Oh, then...

00:11:04.935 --> 00:11:06.445
How about we go grab a beer?

00:11:06.745 --> 00:11:07.905
But I'm dressed like this...

00:11:09.145 --> 00:11:12.115
What? When did I put on your coat?

00:11:13.115 --> 00:11:17.085
- Hey, I put it on you earlier. - You must be cold. Come in here.

00:11:19.485 --> 00:11:20.855
I'm not cold at all.

00:11:21.385 --> 00:11:23.795
I'm on such a high right now, and I feel really warm.

00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:28.025
How about a little walk?

00:11:28.565 --> 00:11:32.605
No, we can't. It's too late, and you'll catch a cold.

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:44.445
You're home late.

00:11:47.585 --> 00:11:48.585
Yes.

00:11:49.755 --> 00:11:50.755
Good night.

00:11:55.795 --> 00:11:57.695
If you were Seong Jae's mother,

00:11:58.355 --> 00:11:59.895
you wouldn't have laid a hand...

00:12:00.525 --> 00:12:02.535
on the woman your son loves.

00:12:07.735 --> 00:12:09.875
It seems she hasn't told him we met.

00:12:10.805 --> 00:12:12.475
Did she actually get my message?

00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:19.185
So instead of making waves, she'll just see him secretly.

00:12:20.185 --> 00:12:22.485
She's really something else.

00:12:26.385 --> 00:12:27.425
Honey.

00:12:28.385 --> 00:12:31.095
About that girl Seong Jae is seeing...

00:12:31.395 --> 00:12:33.895
Oh, her. I told him to go ahead and date her.

00:12:36.565 --> 00:12:37.665
You gave him your permission?

00:12:38.905 --> 00:12:39.905
Why?

00:12:40.505 --> 00:12:44.235
He was so defiant, I was worried he'd just run off if I pushed it.

00:12:44.935 --> 00:12:46.375
I just told him to see how dating goes.

00:12:48.245 --> 00:12:49.375
This is driving me crazy.

00:12:50.215 --> 00:12:53.045
Park Jin Seok, why are you giving in all of a sudden?

00:12:54.015 --> 00:12:56.015
Why? Is something wrong with her?

00:12:57.385 --> 00:12:58.585
No, it's nothing.

00:12:59.455 --> 00:13:02.625
Now that you've let him date her,

00:13:02.895 --> 00:13:04.525
I'm debating whether or not to tell you something...

00:13:05.995 --> 00:13:07.925
No, I have to tell you.

00:13:08.965 --> 00:13:11.535
The thing is, I met that young lady.

00:13:12.765 --> 00:13:13.765
You did?

00:13:14.065 --> 00:13:16.675
I looked into her, and her family's a total disaster.

00:13:17.805 --> 00:13:20.205
Her dad's jobless. Her mom's a clerk,

00:13:20.205 --> 00:13:21.675
and her brothers are no better.

00:13:22.175 --> 00:13:24.275
And she's a YouTuber.

00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:28.285
Gosh, I knew it.

00:13:30.155 --> 00:13:33.155
So I tried to end things on my own. I spoke to her nicely about it.

00:13:34.225 --> 00:13:37.595
But she clammed up. And she hasn't told Seong Jae.

00:13:39.095 --> 00:13:41.625
She didn't tell Seong Jae that she met with you?

00:13:43.565 --> 00:13:44.895
She didn't tell him.

00:13:45.535 --> 00:13:47.505
So you can't tell Seong Jae either.

00:13:51.035 --> 00:13:53.345
Why do you think she didn't tell him?

00:13:54.745 --> 00:13:56.575
That girl knows what she's doing.

00:13:59.115 --> 00:14:00.945
So she's got some nerve.

00:14:03.155 --> 00:14:07.055
She's playing dumb to keep seeing him without making a scene.

00:14:07.855 --> 00:14:10.055
And on top of that, you gave him your permission.

00:14:10.425 --> 00:14:12.565
My heart just sank.

00:14:13.995 --> 00:14:16.165
You should've talked to me before you met with her.

00:14:16.995 --> 00:14:20.505
Did you discuss it with me before letting Seong Jae date her?

00:14:21.105 --> 00:14:23.635
- That's... - Forget it.

00:14:25.175 --> 00:14:26.875
Fine.

00:14:27.605 --> 00:14:29.145
Since I'm the stepmom,

00:14:30.575 --> 00:14:34.185
I wanted to do something for Seong Jae behind your back.

00:14:34.945 --> 00:14:36.555
And because I'm the stepmom,

00:14:37.015 --> 00:14:40.685
you probably figured you didn't need to discuss his love life with me.

00:14:42.025 --> 00:14:44.255
Come on, that's not it.

00:14:44.855 --> 00:14:46.495
From my perspective, after meeting that girl,

00:14:46.825 --> 00:14:49.335
I thought you'd need to step in, but...

00:14:49.735 --> 00:14:51.695
I guess that's not necessary anymore.

00:14:53.135 --> 00:14:56.805
If you've given your blessing, then the ship has sailed.

00:14:58.845 --> 00:15:00.105
No, we can't let that happen.

00:15:00.705 --> 00:15:01.875
Whatever.

00:15:02.345 --> 00:15:05.645
If you're worried about his future, you can deal with it yourself.

00:15:11.785 --> 00:15:13.925
Su Bin, I got home safe.

00:15:15.955 --> 00:15:17.195
You're not catching a cold, are you?

00:15:18.495 --> 00:15:21.025
It takes more than that for me to catch a cold.

00:15:21.025 --> 00:15:23.935
(It takes more than that for me to catch a cold.)

00:15:24.135 --> 00:15:25.865
That's reassuring.

00:15:25.935 --> 00:15:28.835
(That's reassuring.)

00:15:29.005 --> 00:15:31.535
I'll always be here for you. Now, get some sleep.

00:15:31.935 --> 00:15:33.675
You haven't been sleeping well, have you?

00:15:33.745 --> 00:15:34.875
(You haven't been sleeping well, have you?)

00:15:35.275 --> 00:15:38.275
You too. Sleep tight, and don't even dream.

00:15:38.575 --> 00:15:40.815
(Lee Su Bin)

00:15:40.985 --> 00:15:41.985
I love you.

00:15:42.045 --> 00:15:44.285
(Lee Su Bin)

00:15:44.285 --> 00:15:47.985
(I love you.)

00:15:49.895 --> 00:15:51.695
Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:53.325
(Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow.)

00:16:08.945 --> 00:16:09.945
Dad.

00:16:10.475 --> 00:16:13.745
How did you two first meet? Just tell me that much.

00:16:14.085 --> 00:16:16.415
Seriously, I was so curious I couldn't even sleep.

00:16:17.115 --> 00:16:18.685
Ask her yourself.

00:16:19.355 --> 00:16:23.755
No, Dad, you know how much I like Eun Oh.

00:16:24.495 --> 00:16:27.865
So what you told her about me is really important!

00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:30.035
I'm sure it's important to you.

00:16:30.465 --> 00:16:32.805
Dad. I'm your son!

00:16:33.365 --> 00:16:36.105
Hey! Can't you see I'm busy trying to make breakfast here?

00:16:36.175 --> 00:16:37.435
Now, hurry up and get to work.

00:16:37.835 --> 00:16:39.445
You're unbelievable.

00:16:39.975 --> 00:16:42.175
Mom, is Dad always like this?

00:16:43.445 --> 00:16:45.115
He's always had a mean streak.

00:16:46.315 --> 00:16:49.955
You must have had it rough, Mom. Anyway, I'm heading out.

00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:55.825
You seem to enjoy teasing Ji Hyuk.

00:16:56.155 --> 00:16:58.155
Yes. It's a lot of fun.

00:16:58.625 --> 00:17:00.625
After all, the universe hasn't abandoned me.

00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:03.065
For the first time in my life, I'm holding all the cards, honey.

00:17:08.435 --> 00:17:10.075
Oh, you're early today.

00:17:11.505 --> 00:17:16.245
Eun Oh, just tell me one thing. How did you and my father meet?

00:17:16.845 --> 00:17:18.815
Didn't your father tell you?

00:17:19.815 --> 00:17:21.745
No, he said I should hear it from you.

00:17:23.585 --> 00:17:25.885
It's my private life, so I'd rather not say.

00:17:26.285 --> 00:17:30.155
Come on, we're talking about my father here.

00:17:30.995 --> 00:17:33.025
But he's also my friend.

00:17:33.365 --> 00:17:36.035
Why do I have to tell my CEO about my personal friendships?

00:17:42.205 --> 00:17:44.075
Seriously, why are they both doing this to me?

00:17:44.405 --> 00:17:46.075
Are they trying to drive me crazy with curiosity?

00:17:46.375 --> 00:17:47.905
Gosh, I'm seriously going to lose my mind.

00:17:49.475 --> 00:17:50.475
Goodness.

00:17:53.185 --> 00:17:56.715
Mr. Lee keeps asking me where we first met.

00:17:57.415 --> 00:17:58.685
Didn't you tell him?

00:18:00.855 --> 00:18:02.955
I didn't, just to get on his nerves.

00:18:06.765 --> 00:18:07.965
(Mr. Early)

00:18:07.965 --> 00:18:10.735
So, should I keep it from him too?

00:18:13.035 --> 00:18:14.305
No, go ahead and tell him.

00:18:14.705 --> 00:18:16.405
He can't stand being left in the dark.

00:18:21.305 --> 00:18:22.315
That's for sure.

00:18:34.055 --> 00:18:37.295
I'm going to be swamped all day, so I won't be able to get in touch.

00:18:37.955 --> 00:18:41.395
Me too. I'm planning a new project, so I'm going to be busy all day.

00:18:45.465 --> 00:18:46.705
She wants me to focus on work.

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:49.175
So she's pretending to be busy, too.

00:18:53.505 --> 00:18:55.175
(Submission: "Take My Heart," Episode 58)

00:18:55.175 --> 00:18:56.675
(Your email has been sent.)

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:59.345
Ji Wan, I just sent in Episode 58.

00:18:59.685 --> 00:19:01.545
Hey, you were supposed to show me that first!

00:19:02.085 --> 00:19:03.555
But you already know the whole plot.

00:19:04.215 --> 00:19:07.055
The fans have been waiting so long, I felt rushed.

00:19:07.455 --> 00:19:08.725
Just read it on Neiro like everyone else.

00:19:09.655 --> 00:19:11.425
You really care about your fans.

00:19:17.835 --> 00:19:19.605
Any word from Director Ko?

00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:22.605
Since you submitted your resignation,

00:19:23.235 --> 00:19:24.935
I think the misunderstanding has cleared up on its own.

00:19:25.775 --> 00:19:26.975
What misunderstanding?

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:30.475
Hey, who kisses like that?

00:19:31.075 --> 00:19:33.645
Then you both lean in at the same time.

00:19:34.345 --> 00:19:35.485
What do you two think you're doing?

00:19:40.185 --> 00:19:41.185
Oh, that...

00:19:53.965 --> 00:19:56.505
Well... Should we check the comments?

00:20:00.845 --> 00:20:03.775
Wow, it's already flooded with comments!

00:20:05.015 --> 00:20:08.385
Dokgo Chan's so alpha male. I bet Freedom is a man.

00:20:09.855 --> 00:20:13.285
A man can't draw a guy that hot. I bet it's a woman.

00:20:14.685 --> 00:20:17.725
This being your first series, there's nothing about you online.

00:20:17.995 --> 00:20:19.965
Hey, people seem to be really curious about you.

00:20:21.195 --> 00:20:22.295
You're only just realizing that now?

00:20:22.835 --> 00:20:25.265
People have been wondering about the writer since Episode Three.

00:20:27.005 --> 00:20:29.135
What good will their curiosity do?

00:20:29.135 --> 00:20:31.035
The writer, Freedom, will just vanish.

00:20:32.445 --> 00:20:34.875
- Why? - Because when I quit,

00:20:36.245 --> 00:20:38.515
I won't be able to lend you my name anymore.

00:20:48.855 --> 00:20:52.355
Here. I'll be waiting nearby, so text me when you're done.

00:20:54.565 --> 00:20:57.735
Ji Wan, let me have that story. The Rapunzel one.

00:20:58.365 --> 00:20:59.735
I want to make it my next series.

00:21:00.865 --> 00:21:01.865
And why would I do that?

00:21:02.975 --> 00:21:05.405
- What? - Why would I give my story to you?

00:21:05.705 --> 00:21:08.145
A professional has to write it for people to actually read it.

00:21:08.675 --> 00:21:11.375
- I'll be a full-time artist. - Really?

00:21:11.675 --> 00:21:13.685
Can you get the Chairman's approval?

00:21:16.555 --> 00:21:18.215
But he's so scary.

00:21:19.085 --> 00:21:21.225
If you get his permission, I'll give it to you.

00:21:23.025 --> 00:21:25.865
I'm going to be a full-time artist with or without his permission.

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:29.095
Go on, then.

00:21:34.735 --> 00:21:36.205
He doesn't believe me, does he?

00:21:43.315 --> 00:21:45.175
Good luck, Artist Park Yeong Ra.

00:21:49.085 --> 00:21:50.855
This is a debit card in my name.

00:21:51.415 --> 00:21:54.225
With this, your mom won't be able to track you.

00:21:55.585 --> 00:21:57.255
About the bankbook and the seal,

00:21:57.525 --> 00:22:00.465
I'll send them with your belongings to Yeong In's guesthouse in Busan.

00:22:06.805 --> 00:22:08.465
If it hadn't been for you, Woo Jin,

00:22:09.275 --> 00:22:11.335
I never would have gone through with the liver transplant.

00:22:12.745 --> 00:22:15.305
I did it for you, because you're my friend.

00:22:18.315 --> 00:22:21.715
And if I hadn't, I never would've gotten this money.

00:22:22.515 --> 00:22:23.755
So basically,

00:22:24.785 --> 00:22:26.855
this is just a windfall for me.

00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:34.395
Well...

00:22:35.325 --> 00:22:37.295
If you insist on paying me back someday,

00:22:37.865 --> 00:22:39.065
I won't say no.

00:22:41.665 --> 00:22:42.705
I'll pay you back.

00:22:47.805 --> 00:22:49.315
And thank you. I really mean it.

00:22:50.675 --> 00:22:52.045
You've got this, right?

00:22:53.645 --> 00:22:54.715
Yes.

00:22:57.155 --> 00:22:58.585
You've got this too, right?

00:23:00.085 --> 00:23:01.085
Hey.

00:23:01.355 --> 00:23:03.725
I'm the architect of this whole plan.

00:23:08.695 --> 00:23:10.035
But I'm your big brother.

00:23:14.135 --> 00:23:15.865
I couldn't protect you before,

00:23:17.635 --> 00:23:19.205
and now I'm the one who needs your help.

00:23:21.845 --> 00:23:22.915
Han Woo Jin.

00:23:23.745 --> 00:23:25.615
We agreed we wouldn't do this.

00:23:26.185 --> 00:23:29.145
I told you. Just forget that we're twins.

00:23:30.185 --> 00:23:31.515
For us,

00:23:32.485 --> 00:23:34.955
the moment we acknowledge we're related by blood,

00:23:35.825 --> 00:23:38.095
it'll be hard to escape her shadow.

00:23:41.525 --> 00:23:42.525
Still...

00:23:43.535 --> 00:23:44.965
I'm Ji Eun Oh.

00:23:46.105 --> 00:23:47.205
You're Han Woo Jin.

00:23:48.205 --> 00:23:49.735
We're just friends.

00:23:50.905 --> 00:23:52.075
There is no Han Yu Ra.

00:23:56.715 --> 00:23:58.845
Okay. Let's do that.

00:24:06.955 --> 00:24:07.955
Woo Jin.

00:24:11.225 --> 00:24:12.795
You have company.

00:24:13.825 --> 00:24:16.665
Hi. I'm Woo Jin's little sister.

00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:21.265
Hi. Nice to meet you.

00:24:22.205 --> 00:24:23.235
Is she your girlfriend?

00:24:24.875 --> 00:24:26.575
No, we're just friends.

00:24:28.405 --> 00:24:29.675
She's a friend from high school.

00:24:33.345 --> 00:24:34.745
I should get going.

00:24:36.355 --> 00:24:40.085
- Are you leaving because of me? - No, I was about to leave anyway.

00:24:40.755 --> 00:24:42.025
But wait,

00:24:42.555 --> 00:24:46.695
I've never met Woo Jin's friends. What do you do for a living?

00:24:46.765 --> 00:24:47.865
Are you married?

00:24:50.565 --> 00:24:52.265
Does she look married to you?

00:24:52.835 --> 00:24:55.765
Considering your age, I was just curious.

00:24:57.075 --> 00:24:58.835
So, what is it that you do?

00:25:00.045 --> 00:25:01.545
I'm an interior designer.

00:25:02.005 --> 00:25:03.475
Really?

00:25:03.475 --> 00:25:06.685
I've been worried about the interior for my new studio.

00:25:07.515 --> 00:25:09.045
Could I get your business card?

00:25:11.115 --> 00:25:13.255
I wonder if I brought my card case.

00:25:14.825 --> 00:25:17.895
Or just tell me your company's name. And your phone number.

00:25:18.295 --> 00:25:21.295
Yeong Ra, are you redoing your art studio?

00:25:21.825 --> 00:25:24.195
Not my art studio. I got a new workspace.

00:25:26.665 --> 00:25:27.865
I have my business card.

00:25:28.365 --> 00:25:29.375
Here you go.

00:25:29.835 --> 00:25:31.105
Thank you.

00:25:31.475 --> 00:25:32.505
All right, then.

00:25:33.305 --> 00:25:34.405
I'll get going.

00:25:35.005 --> 00:25:36.075
Okay.

00:25:41.045 --> 00:25:43.355
You should have at least called to see if Mom was here.

00:25:43.985 --> 00:25:45.015
It's okay now.

00:25:46.555 --> 00:25:49.155
Here. Some bread. You can eat this now, right?

00:25:51.195 --> 00:25:52.195
Yes.

00:25:52.555 --> 00:25:55.995
- What do you do in here all day? - Well...

00:25:58.095 --> 00:26:01.635
I've been reading webtoons. You got me hooked, Yeong Ra.

00:26:02.005 --> 00:26:05.405
That webtoon you recommended. It's amazing.

00:26:05.405 --> 00:26:06.475
Really?

00:26:06.475 --> 00:26:09.915
A new episode came out today. I read it as soon as I woke up.

00:26:10.515 --> 00:26:11.875
That author...

00:26:12.475 --> 00:26:14.385
has such an incredible imagination,

00:26:14.815 --> 00:26:19.085
blending drama and romance so well. It's a fantastic read.

00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:23.295
- Is it really that good? - Totally.

00:26:23.825 --> 00:26:26.225
I'm so curious about the writer.

00:26:35.635 --> 00:26:36.935
What's wrong? What is it, Yeong Ra?

00:26:38.235 --> 00:26:39.335
Are you not feeling well?

00:26:41.575 --> 00:26:44.275
Woo Jin. The truth is, I drew it.

00:26:44.615 --> 00:26:45.715
I'm the author.

00:26:47.645 --> 00:26:49.145
What? You wrote it?

00:26:50.685 --> 00:26:51.785
Hard to believe, isn't it?

00:27:00.895 --> 00:27:02.265
Woo Jin, what's wrong?

00:27:03.065 --> 00:27:04.395
That webtoon...

00:27:07.205 --> 00:27:08.665
You worked on it behind Mom's back?

00:27:14.145 --> 00:27:15.945
It must have been so hard on you.

00:27:20.045 --> 00:27:21.045
Yes.

00:27:25.985 --> 00:27:27.155
Yeong Ra.

00:27:29.555 --> 00:27:30.855
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

00:27:37.935 --> 00:27:39.265
All this time,

00:27:41.305 --> 00:27:44.005
I never even knew how to be a proper older brother to you.

00:27:46.205 --> 00:27:47.405
It's okay.

00:27:48.205 --> 00:27:50.045
I know why you've been the way you are.

00:27:57.355 --> 00:27:59.585
You have a real talent for making webtoons.

00:28:02.485 --> 00:28:05.025
But I don't have the courage to tell you to pursue it.

00:28:09.265 --> 00:28:10.535
I know that too.

00:28:19.235 --> 00:28:20.905
But I will tell you this.

00:28:21.505 --> 00:28:23.845
At some point, there are choices to be made.

00:28:25.045 --> 00:28:26.745
There comes a time when you have to decide.

00:28:26.945 --> 00:28:28.215
And...

00:28:29.315 --> 00:28:31.315
that's a decision only you can make.

00:28:34.985 --> 00:28:35.985
Okay?

00:28:39.255 --> 00:28:40.265
Yes.

00:28:47.835 --> 00:28:50.575
A strong start is important,

00:28:50.635 --> 00:28:53.175
so let's aim to finish 3 to 5 pieces first,

00:28:53.245 --> 00:28:55.775
and then we can arrange them in the showroom.

00:28:55.775 --> 00:28:57.145
Okay, sure.

00:29:02.385 --> 00:29:04.385
You two have been working way too hard lately.

00:29:06.355 --> 00:29:08.255
You've still got a long meeting ahead of you.

00:29:08.725 --> 00:29:09.755
Thanks.

00:29:14.895 --> 00:29:15.995
Ms. Ji.

00:29:17.895 --> 00:29:18.895
Thanks.

00:29:27.875 --> 00:29:29.145
You have one too, Cheol Min.

00:29:32.245 --> 00:29:34.745
My head was full of questions that I couldn't sleep.

00:29:36.815 --> 00:29:37.815
Let's get back to work.

00:29:44.555 --> 00:29:47.825
Before this curiosity drives me mad, I need to have a drink with my dad.

00:29:48.865 --> 00:29:49.935
Dad.

00:29:56.375 --> 00:29:59.235
The son who's giving my dear Mr. Early so much grief.

00:30:00.575 --> 00:30:01.575
"Early?"

00:30:02.045 --> 00:30:04.345
- What does that mean? - Your father.

00:30:05.275 --> 00:30:07.485
I met him working as a laborer at the Mapo site.

00:30:08.715 --> 00:30:10.915
Wait, you met my dad at the construction site?

00:30:11.615 --> 00:30:12.615
I saw a man on the street...

00:30:12.615 --> 00:30:14.985
who looked like my dad for three seconds.

00:30:15.225 --> 00:30:17.925
And that same man showed up at the Mapo site.

00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:21.895
When I saw his soft hands without a single callus,

00:30:22.525 --> 00:30:26.565
I was reminded of my own dad after his business failed.

00:30:27.265 --> 00:30:28.305
That's what happened.

00:30:32.035 --> 00:30:35.175
Wait, I was at that site too. How did I miss him?

00:30:35.805 --> 00:30:39.075
He only came for one day because of class, and after that,

00:30:39.145 --> 00:30:42.145
we met again by chance at the corner store by the office.

00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:44.715
And you two got friendly just like that?

00:30:45.255 --> 00:30:48.055
Don't expect me to spill everything about my friend.

00:30:50.695 --> 00:30:52.625
From now on, you should listen to your dad.

00:30:53.365 --> 00:30:54.625
Mr. Early...

00:30:54.895 --> 00:30:57.435
Do you have any idea how worried he was about you?

00:30:58.295 --> 00:31:00.905
Wait, my dad was worried about me?

00:31:01.405 --> 00:31:02.405
Yes.

00:31:04.075 --> 00:31:05.805
Having a great dad like that...

00:31:06.775 --> 00:31:07.875
I'm jealous, Ji Hyuk.

00:31:13.045 --> 00:31:16.915
(Apfel Kitchen)

00:31:19.055 --> 00:31:21.655
My dad was telling a stranger he was worried about me?

00:31:30.795 --> 00:31:33.965
I'm going to be swamped all day, so I won't be able to get in touch.

00:31:34.835 --> 00:31:38.535
Me too. I'm planning a new project, so I'm going to be busy all day.

00:31:41.745 --> 00:31:43.245
I know I said I'd be busy today,

00:31:44.215 --> 00:31:46.275
but she really hasn't texted me all day.

00:31:51.815 --> 00:31:53.425
Wow, these bean sprouts look nice and fresh.

00:31:55.655 --> 00:31:57.355
What? Who's here?

00:32:03.995 --> 00:32:07.235
Hey, Seong Jae! What a surprise. What brings you here?

00:32:07.505 --> 00:32:09.435
I was just visiting one of our franchise locations nearby.

00:32:10.105 --> 00:32:12.775
- The fruit next door looked great. - Really?

00:32:12.835 --> 00:32:15.245
Father. You're wearing an apron?

00:32:15.745 --> 00:32:18.715
Seong Jae. I'm the head cook around here now.

00:32:19.175 --> 00:32:20.185
What?

00:32:20.245 --> 00:32:23.715
Everyone else in my family works, and I felt bad just sitting around,

00:32:24.055 --> 00:32:25.415
so I'm running the kitchen now.

00:32:27.025 --> 00:32:28.825
Wow, that's really impressive.

00:32:29.185 --> 00:32:31.595
They say there are two types of men after retirement.

00:32:31.995 --> 00:32:34.265
The ones who cook, and the ones who get served.

00:32:34.695 --> 00:32:36.895
It's not that big of a deal.

00:32:38.165 --> 00:32:41.165
- So what are you making today? - Some spicy braised monkfish.

00:32:41.665 --> 00:32:45.475
My wife always has spicy dishes like pork or squid stir-fry ready.

00:32:45.975 --> 00:32:49.405
But she and Su Bin love spicy braised monkfish.

00:32:50.275 --> 00:32:51.275
I know.

00:32:53.215 --> 00:32:55.345
So Mother likes spicy braised monkfish?

00:32:56.445 --> 00:32:58.085
- Let me help you with that. - What?

00:32:58.085 --> 00:32:59.955
- I'll just go wash my hands. - Okay.

00:33:04.425 --> 00:33:08.225
This monkfish looks way grosser than I expected.

00:33:10.495 --> 00:33:12.265
- I'll wash it. - What?

00:33:13.095 --> 00:33:15.065
- Hey, hold on. - There we go.

00:33:15.135 --> 00:33:16.975
You've never done this before, have you?

00:33:18.305 --> 00:33:19.335
My goodness.

00:33:26.175 --> 00:33:27.185
Oh, boy.

00:33:29.515 --> 00:33:30.515
Four.

00:33:32.415 --> 00:33:34.285
Five. Okay, that's enough soy sauce. What's next?

00:33:34.625 --> 00:33:38.525
- Three spoonfuls of minced garlic. - Three spoonfuls of minced garlic.

00:33:39.055 --> 00:33:42.095
- My, that smells good. - Okay, put it on top.

00:33:42.165 --> 00:33:43.735
- Okay. - Go on, put it in.

00:33:44.535 --> 00:33:45.865
Okay. That's enough.

00:33:51.135 --> 00:33:52.135
Oh, my!

00:33:52.935 --> 00:33:54.305
This is really good.

00:33:54.305 --> 00:33:55.945
Really? Let me try.

00:34:01.315 --> 00:34:02.685
Hey, this isn't half bad.

00:34:03.185 --> 00:34:04.855
Hey, look at us. We made spicy braised monkfish!

00:34:05.155 --> 00:34:07.055
You know, with a dish like this...

00:34:07.525 --> 00:34:10.125
- You've got to have soju. - You know it!

00:34:11.055 --> 00:34:13.695
Will you look at this guy? He knows how to respect his elders.

00:34:14.025 --> 00:34:15.865
He can't stand an empty glass, this guy.

00:34:17.465 --> 00:34:20.305
I'm not trying to be attentive. An empty glass is just hard to miss.

00:34:20.365 --> 00:34:21.505
- Is that right? - Really?

00:34:21.505 --> 00:34:24.305
Park Seong Jae. What is going on here now?

00:34:24.605 --> 00:34:26.435
Hey, Ji Hyuk. Have you eaten?

00:34:26.775 --> 00:34:30.545
Hey! Lee Ji Hyuk! That was the wrong answer.

00:34:30.915 --> 00:34:34.385
You should learn from Seong Jae. He asked if you'd eaten right away.

00:34:35.115 --> 00:34:36.755
You're just so thoughtful.

00:34:39.185 --> 00:34:41.255
Wait, Mom, have you been drinking soju, too?

00:34:41.485 --> 00:34:44.325
No, I'm having wine.

00:34:45.395 --> 00:34:49.225
Seong Jae knew I can't drink soju, so he brought this wine just for me.

00:34:49.795 --> 00:34:50.935
Right, so what is this?

00:34:51.295 --> 00:34:54.005
Seong Jae, I'm asking you what you're doing sitting there.

00:34:54.065 --> 00:34:57.975
Hey! Didn't you hear your mother? Are you being deliberately dense?

00:34:58.375 --> 00:35:01.405
This is hardly the first time Seong Jae has been over for dinner.

00:35:01.705 --> 00:35:04.775
Why do you have to be so harsh? Seong Jae is like family.

00:35:05.275 --> 00:35:08.185
It's all right, Father. Ji Hyuk's just a little rough.

00:35:08.615 --> 00:35:10.485
So anyway, Ji Hyuk, have you eaten?

00:35:11.585 --> 00:35:12.815
Yes, I have. So what?

00:35:13.255 --> 00:35:14.685
Fine. Go wash up and get some rest.

00:35:15.955 --> 00:35:18.455
Gosh, what do I do? I can't just go to my room now.

00:35:21.025 --> 00:35:24.695
You know what? I'll have a glass of wine, too.

00:35:26.735 --> 00:35:28.935
- I'm home. - Hey.

00:35:29.005 --> 00:35:31.775
Look who it is. My little sister's home.

00:35:33.305 --> 00:35:34.545
Seong Jae. You're here.

00:35:37.375 --> 00:35:40.085
My gosh, what's all this? What's the special occasion?

00:35:40.685 --> 00:35:41.915
Su Bin, have you eaten yet?

00:35:42.385 --> 00:35:43.815
We saved some spicy braised monkfish for you.

00:35:44.615 --> 00:35:47.985
- No, Seong Jae, I'll get it. - No, please.

00:35:48.255 --> 00:35:50.555
Tonight's guys' night in the kitchen remember?

00:35:55.595 --> 00:35:57.895
That jerk, Seong Jae. Where did he pick up that charm?

00:36:02.905 --> 00:36:03.905
You two planned this, didn't you?

00:36:04.405 --> 00:36:07.505
No, we didn't. I'm serious. I had no idea.

00:36:10.515 --> 00:36:11.975
All right.

00:36:13.215 --> 00:36:14.215
Here you go.

00:36:16.955 --> 00:36:18.785
Your dad and I made this together.

00:36:19.385 --> 00:36:21.555
Dad and Seong Jae made spicy braised monkfish together?

00:36:22.025 --> 00:36:25.325
I know, right? They made this with fresh monkfish.

00:36:26.055 --> 00:36:27.225
Can you believe it?

00:36:27.595 --> 00:36:29.365
They even made steamed eggs with pollock roe.

00:36:30.465 --> 00:36:33.905
Steamed eggs with pollock roe, Su Bin's favorite. She'll love it.

00:36:34.505 --> 00:36:36.735
Su Bin likes steamed eggs with pollock roe?

00:36:37.235 --> 00:36:38.705
You didn't even know that, did you?

00:36:42.175 --> 00:36:43.915
- This is delicious! - Yes.

00:36:49.545 --> 00:36:50.555
It's so good.

00:36:54.055 --> 00:36:55.755
Park Seong Jae.

00:36:56.525 --> 00:36:58.025
What do you think you're doing?

00:36:58.955 --> 00:37:01.365
What were you thinking, coming to my house?

00:37:02.065 --> 00:37:04.295
What? Am I not allowed to be here?

00:37:04.765 --> 00:37:07.865
You didn't come as my friend, right? You're here as Su Bin's boyfriend.

00:37:08.435 --> 00:37:09.435
I...

00:37:10.205 --> 00:37:12.575
I got my father's permission to date her.

00:37:14.005 --> 00:37:17.075
What? You got permission from the Chairman?

00:37:17.415 --> 00:37:18.415
I did, man.

00:37:20.045 --> 00:37:24.215
Still, being here is out of line. This place is off-limits to you.

00:37:24.285 --> 00:37:25.785
You never should have come.

00:37:26.685 --> 00:37:28.455
You sure have a nasty way of putting things.

00:37:29.325 --> 00:37:31.595
Besides, why is it any of your business?

00:37:31.995 --> 00:37:33.125
Really?

00:37:33.565 --> 00:37:35.365
Fine, let's go ask my parents then.

00:37:35.425 --> 00:37:37.395
Hey! Come on, Ji Hyuk.

00:37:37.795 --> 00:37:39.495
See? This is what I'm talking about!

00:37:40.505 --> 00:37:42.135
This isn't getting you anywhere, Seong Jae.

00:37:42.705 --> 00:37:44.075
I thought you were only dating for 100 days.

00:37:44.805 --> 00:37:47.075
So why are you trying to get on my parents' good side?

00:37:47.345 --> 00:37:49.645
You should be trying to lie low for those 100 days.

00:37:50.975 --> 00:37:51.975
You have a point.

00:37:53.115 --> 00:37:54.315
What was I thinking?

00:37:57.185 --> 00:37:58.615
It's not about the timeframe.

00:37:59.285 --> 00:38:01.585
I guess I wanted their blessing, too.

00:38:03.285 --> 00:38:04.355
You were the same way.

00:38:04.825 --> 00:38:06.895
You felt the same way about Eun Oh. You wished you were her husband.

00:38:07.765 --> 00:38:10.235
With all that Eun Oh's been through recently,

00:38:10.935 --> 00:38:13.965
I found myself thinking, "What if I were her husband?"

00:38:14.365 --> 00:38:15.735
That's exactly how I feel.

00:38:16.935 --> 00:38:18.375
When Su Bin needs me,

00:38:19.075 --> 00:38:21.775
I want to be a man who can step up and do anything for her.

00:38:22.945 --> 00:38:23.945
But...

00:38:24.515 --> 00:38:26.745
your parents are such warm people.

00:38:26.915 --> 00:38:29.615
I thought there was a chance they might accept me.

00:38:32.455 --> 00:38:33.625
I really wanted them to like me.

00:38:34.285 --> 00:38:35.725
Look at this guy getting his hopes up.

00:38:36.055 --> 00:38:40.325
Hey, your dad probably only said yes because he thinks it's just a fling.

00:38:40.565 --> 00:38:41.625
Don't make this more than it is.

00:38:42.065 --> 00:38:44.195
Because it's obvious my sister is the one who'll get hurt.

00:38:44.565 --> 00:38:46.835
Will you stop jumping to conclusions?

00:38:48.505 --> 00:38:49.505
Ji Hyuk.

00:38:51.935 --> 00:38:53.035
Su Bin, come on in.

00:38:53.505 --> 00:38:54.705
No, you can't come in here!

00:38:55.845 --> 00:38:57.445
Should I go to her room instead, then?

00:38:58.075 --> 00:38:59.075
Are you crazy?

00:39:06.515 --> 00:39:08.885
You two are in your own world, aren't you?

00:39:09.225 --> 00:39:10.925
Ji Hyuk, you promised.

00:39:12.655 --> 00:39:15.595
Seong Jae. Why didn't you text me you were coming?

00:39:16.765 --> 00:39:18.165
I thought if you found out,

00:39:18.735 --> 00:39:21.165
you'd just end up worrying for no reason.

00:39:22.835 --> 00:39:25.605
That must've been tough. I bet you've never cooked before.

00:39:26.435 --> 00:39:27.745
It was actually a lot of fun.

00:39:28.305 --> 00:39:29.605
Maybe it's because I was doing it with your dad?

00:39:31.345 --> 00:39:33.315
Give me a break.

00:39:44.195 --> 00:39:45.855
Did Seong Jae get off okay?

00:39:46.625 --> 00:39:48.725
Yes. He's off with the designated driver.

00:39:49.925 --> 00:39:51.495
What's with the attitude?

00:39:52.195 --> 00:39:54.265
Seriously, Mom, what is so great about Seong Jae?

00:39:54.535 --> 00:39:55.865
He's always been your favorite.

00:39:56.435 --> 00:39:59.235
He's just freeloading off us. What's so great about that?

00:40:00.275 --> 00:40:04.115
Seong Jae never shied away from me or any other adults.

00:40:04.775 --> 00:40:07.285
Your friends and even your siblings' friends...

00:40:07.385 --> 00:40:10.045
wouldn't include me, even when I was curious and nearby.

00:40:10.455 --> 00:40:12.915
But Seong Jae always took the time to talk to me.

00:40:14.355 --> 00:40:15.355
He did?

00:40:15.855 --> 00:40:16.855
Of course.

00:40:17.395 --> 00:40:20.425
He always has. Even now, when I'm preparing a meal,

00:40:20.495 --> 00:40:22.725
he'll come over, hang around, and keep me company.

00:40:23.165 --> 00:40:24.795
Do you have any idea how much that means to me?

00:40:25.465 --> 00:40:27.035
Really? You're thankful for that?

00:40:27.865 --> 00:40:31.035
You may be my son, but ever since high school,

00:40:31.605 --> 00:40:33.605
have we even talked for 30 minutes a week?

00:40:34.945 --> 00:40:37.445
I say, "Dinner's ready. Wash up,"

00:40:37.445 --> 00:40:39.415
and all I get is, "Yes," or "Okay."

00:40:40.515 --> 00:40:42.885
Come on, Mom. Thirty minutes is a huge exaggeration.

00:40:43.245 --> 00:40:46.515
That's how it feels. That's just how it's been.

00:40:47.585 --> 00:40:49.725
Say an old woman on the street asks for directions.

00:40:50.395 --> 00:40:55.425
If you help her, she'll pull out a melted caramel from her pocket.

00:40:56.025 --> 00:41:00.365
That's what it's like. The young are awkward around elders.

00:41:02.305 --> 00:41:05.235
So that's what older people appreciate.

00:41:15.385 --> 00:41:16.945
Man, that Seong Jae.

00:41:18.155 --> 00:41:20.925
Always trying to get brownie points. It's so annoying.

00:41:21.855 --> 00:41:23.285
Mom already adores you as it is.

00:41:26.425 --> 00:41:30.365
Seong Jae never shied away from me or any other adults.

00:41:30.995 --> 00:41:33.065
But Seong Jae always took the time to talk to me.

00:41:34.035 --> 00:41:35.905
He'd come over and hang around.

00:41:36.365 --> 00:41:38.035
Do you have any idea how much that means to me?

00:41:40.875 --> 00:41:43.975
So that's what older people like.

00:41:46.215 --> 00:41:47.215
All right, then.

00:41:48.615 --> 00:41:49.985
(Urgent: Interior worker needed)

00:41:50.045 --> 00:41:51.855
(Urgent: Interior wallpapering assistant)

00:41:53.725 --> 00:41:54.785
What?

00:41:55.955 --> 00:41:57.655
That job site must be getting tired of you.

00:41:57.925 --> 00:41:59.155
You've been staring at it so much.

00:41:59.755 --> 00:42:02.065
Goodness, what are you talking about?

00:42:02.395 --> 00:42:04.265
Honey. Lee Sang Cheol.

00:42:05.435 --> 00:42:07.705
Please, just take one month off.

00:42:08.605 --> 00:42:10.335
What would I even do if I took a break?

00:42:11.335 --> 00:42:12.675
By the way, honey.

00:42:13.305 --> 00:42:14.305
By any chance,

00:42:14.675 --> 00:42:17.675
would you ever consider moving out to the provinces?

00:42:18.475 --> 00:42:19.475
Where did that come from?

00:42:19.775 --> 00:42:22.615
Out there, even if you're over 60,

00:42:22.615 --> 00:42:24.515
having an electrical technician license,

00:42:24.815 --> 00:42:26.585
there would still be jobs available.

00:42:27.255 --> 00:42:28.385
Day and night, it's always about...

00:42:28.385 --> 00:42:30.025
that electrical technician license and finding a job.

00:42:30.495 --> 00:42:32.495
I told you to drop that breadwinner complex.

00:42:33.095 --> 00:42:37.565
What's the point? The money to live until we're 90...

00:42:37.635 --> 00:42:39.065
isn't just going to fall from the sky.

00:42:40.065 --> 00:42:41.705
I guess you're planning on living until 90?

00:42:42.165 --> 00:42:44.475
No, that's the problem. I'm like this because I don't know.

00:42:45.035 --> 00:42:48.705
Just hearing people talk about living to 100 makes my heart pound.

00:42:49.345 --> 00:42:51.415
That's why I'm telling you to just rest for one month.

00:42:51.745 --> 00:42:53.945
You might not even live to be 90.

00:42:54.615 --> 00:42:57.215
Have you ever taken a week off in your entire life?

00:42:57.755 --> 00:42:58.915
Have you ever just relaxed and had fun?

00:43:01.255 --> 00:43:02.255
No, I haven't.

00:43:03.385 --> 00:43:04.555
Exactly. You haven't.

00:43:05.255 --> 00:43:07.495
You've spent your whole life living for other people.

00:43:08.325 --> 00:43:10.995
As a father to our kids, as a husband to me,

00:43:11.435 --> 00:43:13.765
as a son to your parents, and a son-in-law to mine.

00:43:15.365 --> 00:43:16.365
So...

00:43:16.965 --> 00:43:18.675
Until you get a job as an electrical technician,

00:43:18.675 --> 00:43:19.975
stop looking for part-time work.

00:43:20.205 --> 00:43:21.245
Just take one month to enjoy yourself.

00:43:22.575 --> 00:43:23.775
For one whole month?

00:43:24.615 --> 00:43:25.815
What would I do with myself?

00:43:27.185 --> 00:43:31.455
While working, did you ever want or envy something others were doing?

00:43:33.085 --> 00:43:34.085
I don't know.

00:43:35.155 --> 00:43:36.685
Well, there were things I hated.

00:43:37.225 --> 00:43:39.325
Being packed like sardines during my commute,

00:43:39.725 --> 00:43:41.725
having to take the bus or the subway.

00:43:43.125 --> 00:43:45.335
Okay, so start thinking of things from there.

00:43:45.865 --> 00:43:48.005
For the next month, don't worry about making breakfast or dinner.

00:43:48.505 --> 00:43:51.105
I'll take care of my own meals, and the kids can just have ramyeon.

00:43:51.335 --> 00:43:52.975
But what about Ji Hyuk?

00:43:53.575 --> 00:43:56.045
He comes home for a real dinner every once in a while.

00:43:56.875 --> 00:43:59.015
Goodness. You big softie.

00:43:59.345 --> 00:44:02.615
You completely melted the moment Ji Hyuk knelt and apologized.

00:44:04.215 --> 00:44:05.215
Did I?

00:44:05.855 --> 00:44:09.385
I can't help it. That's just how parents are.

00:44:10.955 --> 00:44:12.195
That whole "being a parent" thing...

00:44:12.755 --> 00:44:14.195
Take a break from it. Just for one month.

00:44:14.695 --> 00:44:16.265
Live for yourself for a change, Lee Sang Cheol.

00:44:20.265 --> 00:44:21.635
I'll think about it.

00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:33.375
Yes.

00:44:37.285 --> 00:44:39.155
Do you have any plans tonight?

00:44:39.555 --> 00:44:42.055
I'm visiting Woo Jin in the hospital today.

00:44:42.785 --> 00:44:43.785
Again?

00:44:44.555 --> 00:44:48.395
All he looks forward to in the hospital is friends visiting.

00:44:48.965 --> 00:44:51.965
I'd planned a team dinner tonight, but I guess that's out.

00:44:52.565 --> 00:44:53.565
You guys can go without me.

00:44:54.005 --> 00:44:56.135
Team dinners aren't mandatory anymore.

00:44:56.965 --> 00:44:57.975
Right.

00:45:04.445 --> 00:45:07.385
Team dinner tonight, everyone! How does beef sound?

00:45:09.945 --> 00:45:10.955
Today's...

00:45:12.015 --> 00:45:13.055
OOTD.

00:45:13.685 --> 00:45:16.485
But cooking content is a must these days.

00:45:20.765 --> 00:45:21.765
Who could this be?

00:45:23.295 --> 00:45:24.295
Hello?

00:45:24.995 --> 00:45:25.995
Is this Lee Su Bin?

00:45:26.535 --> 00:45:29.865
This is Seong Jae's father. Chairman Park Jin Seok of Shoe Joy.

00:45:30.905 --> 00:45:32.835
Hello, sir.

00:45:33.805 --> 00:45:36.045
I hear you're Seong Jae's girlfriend.

00:45:36.575 --> 00:45:37.875
Let's meet.

00:45:38.575 --> 00:45:39.575
Excuse me?

00:45:41.615 --> 00:45:44.585
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:45:45.385 --> 00:45:46.385
Yes.

00:45:46.785 --> 00:45:50.325
Sir, the buyers from Tokyo have just arrived at the airport.

00:45:50.725 --> 00:45:52.425
You should head to the meeting now.

00:45:53.965 --> 00:45:55.025
Okay, got it.

00:46:01.805 --> 00:46:03.165
This is Seong Jae's father.

00:46:05.405 --> 00:46:07.705
Gosh, even his voice is intimidating.

00:46:08.775 --> 00:46:10.175
Does Seong Jae know about this?

00:46:11.475 --> 00:46:12.975
Should I tell him?

00:46:22.385 --> 00:46:23.385
Hey, Seong Jae.

00:46:24.095 --> 00:46:25.095
What were you up to?

00:46:25.395 --> 00:46:28.465
What? Just putting on makeup.

00:46:29.325 --> 00:46:30.525
Going somewhere?

00:46:31.365 --> 00:46:34.435
You said nothing about going out in your text this morning.

00:46:35.635 --> 00:46:36.835
So he doesn't know.

00:46:37.905 --> 00:46:40.505
A friend from college just called me out of the blue.

00:46:41.345 --> 00:46:42.405
Oh, really?

00:46:43.045 --> 00:46:45.375
Well, I'm on my way to a meeting with some Japanese buyers.

00:46:45.845 --> 00:46:47.585
We'll be touring some franchise locations,

00:46:48.245 --> 00:46:49.645
and I'll probably have dinner with them too.

00:46:50.885 --> 00:46:53.185
Right, you mentioned that yesterday. I hope the meeting goes well.

00:46:54.055 --> 00:46:55.085
Thanks.

00:46:55.455 --> 00:46:57.055
Get something good to eat with your friend, okay?

00:46:57.655 --> 00:46:58.655
Oh, and...

00:46:59.795 --> 00:47:00.925
Make sure you dress warmly.

00:47:02.195 --> 00:47:03.195
Okay, I will.

00:47:10.705 --> 00:47:13.705
Why would he want to see me without Seong Jae knowing?

00:47:18.515 --> 00:47:20.645
I have an appointment with the Chairman at 2pm.

00:47:21.015 --> 00:47:22.885
With Mr. Chairman? One moment, please.

00:47:33.795 --> 00:47:34.795
Su Bin?

00:47:37.325 --> 00:47:39.035
There's no way she'd come here without contacting me.

00:47:41.005 --> 00:47:42.005
It can't be.

00:47:48.975 --> 00:47:49.975
My gosh...

00:47:53.175 --> 00:47:54.185
(Shoealls)

00:48:07.425 --> 00:48:11.095
Hello. My name is Lee Su Bin. You asked to see me.

00:48:12.635 --> 00:48:13.635
Have a seat.

00:48:14.565 --> 00:48:15.565
Yes.

00:48:22.645 --> 00:48:27.445
I called you here out of curiosity. Seong Jae doesn't just date anyone.

00:48:28.845 --> 00:48:31.215
And I can see why Seong Jae likes you.

00:48:32.155 --> 00:48:33.315
What is it you like about Seong Jae?

00:48:34.355 --> 00:48:37.385
There isn't one particular reason why I like him, but...

00:48:38.355 --> 00:48:39.425
He's very affectionate.

00:48:40.425 --> 00:48:41.425
Affectionate?

00:48:42.795 --> 00:48:44.665
But he also seems lonely.

00:48:45.195 --> 00:48:47.835
I want to be the one to fill that void for him.

00:48:49.205 --> 00:48:52.735
So you're with him to fill a void. I like your attitude.

00:48:54.035 --> 00:48:58.515
Relationships must be built on more than simple affection.

00:48:59.645 --> 00:49:00.645
Yes.

00:49:00.945 --> 00:49:02.085
Even so, you're not the one.

00:49:03.715 --> 00:49:06.855
- Pardon? - Marriage is out of the question.

00:49:07.825 --> 00:49:09.685
- But we're just... - Just dating?

00:49:10.325 --> 00:49:12.055
Seong Jae told me.

00:49:14.165 --> 00:49:15.765
But when two people are in love, they naturally...

00:49:16.425 --> 00:49:18.735
think about a future together. That's just human nature.

00:49:20.235 --> 00:49:22.535
Well, apparently, that's not the case for you two,

00:49:22.865 --> 00:49:26.335
since Seong Jae insists you two are "just dating."

00:49:27.305 --> 00:49:28.445
Something's off.

00:49:29.205 --> 00:49:30.875
Get it together, Lee Su Bin.

00:49:33.145 --> 00:49:35.945
- Did you call me because... - Yes.

00:49:36.685 --> 00:49:39.885
You can date him casually, but it can't go any further.

00:49:40.255 --> 00:49:42.425
I called you here to make that perfectly clear.

00:49:43.225 --> 00:49:46.995
If that's what you wanted to say, you could've told him yourself, sir.

00:49:47.795 --> 00:49:49.865
Well... Let's call it a precaution.

00:49:50.725 --> 00:49:51.835
That's how I do things.

00:49:52.865 --> 00:49:56.005
If we cut off any chance of being stabbed in the back,

00:49:56.235 --> 00:49:57.835
neither of us has to waste our energy.

00:50:01.375 --> 00:50:03.145
The heir to a corporate group...

00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:05.775
marries into a family that can be an asset to the company.

00:50:07.345 --> 00:50:10.285
A family we can turn to for help...

00:50:10.285 --> 00:50:13.315
when facing obstacles most people can't even imagine.

00:50:15.055 --> 00:50:16.055
And Seong Jae...

00:50:16.425 --> 00:50:18.555
is the heir to our Shoe Joy Group, is he not?

00:50:19.755 --> 00:50:21.665
He is not a man who can afford to just follow his heart.

00:50:23.425 --> 00:50:24.495
Am I making myself clear?

00:50:26.535 --> 00:50:28.105
I've heard what you've had to say.

00:50:31.735 --> 00:50:35.045
So you've heard me, but you won't agree.

00:50:36.345 --> 00:50:37.405
An answer like that...

00:50:38.475 --> 00:50:40.645
I don't feel obligated to give you that kind of answer, sir.

00:50:41.445 --> 00:50:42.515
What was that?

00:50:45.455 --> 00:50:48.725
Did Seong Jae put you up to this? Did he tell you to say that?

00:50:48.785 --> 00:50:51.895
No. Seong Jae doesn't know I came here.

00:50:54.265 --> 00:50:57.225
- You didn't tell him you came? - That's right.

00:50:58.395 --> 00:50:59.965
And I don't plan on telling him, either.

00:51:00.795 --> 00:51:01.905
And why is that?

00:51:04.405 --> 00:51:06.335
Because it would upset Seong Jae.

00:51:07.775 --> 00:51:09.645
I don't want to see him get hurt.

00:51:12.445 --> 00:51:15.545
Are you really saying you'll never tell Seong Jae?

00:51:17.715 --> 00:51:18.915
I don't plan to.

00:51:21.055 --> 00:51:23.055
If you're finished, I'll see myself out.

00:51:46.845 --> 00:51:50.885
Mom... This room just feels so empty without you.

00:51:53.515 --> 00:51:54.555
Mom.

00:51:55.485 --> 00:51:56.955
Please, try some.

00:51:57.625 --> 00:51:59.755
I made spicy braised monkfish.

00:52:02.325 --> 00:52:04.595
Mom... To think in your whole life,

00:52:05.335 --> 00:52:07.465
I never once cooked a meal for you.

00:52:08.865 --> 00:52:10.605
After a lifetime of you feeding me,

00:52:11.675 --> 00:52:13.735
it never even occurred to me to make a meal for you.

00:52:15.975 --> 00:52:17.075
And, Mom...

00:52:17.715 --> 00:52:21.985
Da Jeong told me to take a month off to just relax.

00:52:23.085 --> 00:52:25.615
It hasn't been long since you left, and I feel a little guilty, but...

00:52:27.155 --> 00:52:28.155
Do you think...

00:52:28.455 --> 00:52:31.725
I could just do the interview and then take a month off?

00:52:33.695 --> 00:52:35.365
(Jamun Medical Devices)

00:52:35.425 --> 00:52:36.425
Welcome.

00:52:37.365 --> 00:52:40.795
I heard your products are very good, so I came to try them out.

00:52:40.965 --> 00:52:42.965
I spent all day volunteering yesterday making kimchi,

00:52:42.965 --> 00:52:45.175
and now my whole body is sore.

00:52:45.775 --> 00:52:48.675
- Go ahead and lie down here. - Okay, thank you.

00:52:49.175 --> 00:52:50.205
Oh, boy.

00:52:54.445 --> 00:52:56.185
How does that feel? Are you comfortable?

00:52:56.815 --> 00:52:58.985
The warmth feels really nice.

00:52:59.415 --> 00:53:01.855
You'll feel much better once the session is over.

00:53:05.125 --> 00:53:09.625
It's improving my circulation. My body feels lighter already.

00:53:10.625 --> 00:53:13.965
Actually, I'm here because I want to start a business.

00:53:14.735 --> 00:53:16.435
People are living to be 100 these days,

00:53:16.635 --> 00:53:19.005
so it's no surprise so many people are focused on their health.

00:53:19.005 --> 00:53:22.245
That's why I was looking into the wellness industry,

00:53:22.475 --> 00:53:23.705
and now that I've tried this for myself,

00:53:24.045 --> 00:53:26.715
I'm thinking a business like this could be a really good fit for me.

00:53:27.515 --> 00:53:29.385
Would you like me to connect you with our corporate office?

00:53:30.315 --> 00:53:32.055
That would be wonderful. Thank you.

00:53:43.195 --> 00:53:45.235
He says we can date, but marriage is off the table.

00:53:46.135 --> 00:53:47.395
What am I supposed to do with that?

00:53:53.475 --> 00:53:55.705
I guess our relationship really does have a 100-day expiration date.

00:53:57.205 --> 00:53:59.145
I shouldn't have suggested we only date for 100 days.

00:54:01.985 --> 00:54:04.415
The reasons we should break up after 100 days just keep piling up.

00:54:08.155 --> 00:54:10.055
She said she wouldn't tell Seong Jae?

00:54:10.425 --> 00:54:11.495
Come on.

00:54:11.495 --> 00:54:13.825
That girl will tell him everything behind our backs.

00:54:14.055 --> 00:54:16.365
Well, if she tells him and Seong Jae comes to confront me,

00:54:16.965 --> 00:54:18.765
I'll just say I was nipping it in the bud.

00:54:19.735 --> 00:54:21.405
I'll say, "As you said,"

00:54:21.635 --> 00:54:24.035
"you're only dating, not getting married."

00:54:24.905 --> 00:54:26.875
"I met her because I was worried. That's all."

00:54:28.705 --> 00:54:29.805
I mean,

00:54:30.545 --> 00:54:32.615
it's not like I treated her harshly or anything.

00:54:34.745 --> 00:54:37.385
But what's with that look on your face?

00:54:38.055 --> 00:54:39.885
Was she disrespectful to you?

00:54:40.615 --> 00:54:41.625
No.

00:54:42.885 --> 00:54:44.655
Actually, the girl herself isn't bad at all.

00:54:45.525 --> 00:54:47.125
Seong Jae has good taste.

00:54:48.425 --> 00:54:50.265
She's a bright young woman,

00:54:50.925 --> 00:54:52.765
and she's fiercely protective of Seong Jae.

00:54:55.235 --> 00:54:58.205
What's this? So, he actually liked her?

00:55:01.975 --> 00:55:04.515
It's a shame her family isn't more respectable.

00:55:06.115 --> 00:55:07.945
Her father's unemployed,

00:55:08.745 --> 00:55:10.845
and you said her brothers were nobodies, right?

00:55:12.185 --> 00:55:14.215
Yes, that's right.

00:55:15.025 --> 00:55:18.125
A person's character is a reflection of their upbringing, after all.

00:55:19.355 --> 00:55:23.695
No matter how decent she might be, Seong Jae is the family's first son.

00:55:24.595 --> 00:55:26.565
She's nowhere near good enough for him.

00:55:27.695 --> 00:55:28.905
Of course, she isn't.

00:55:31.735 --> 00:55:33.875
The fact that she's a decent kid makes me even more worried.

00:55:35.145 --> 00:55:37.945
If they're this crazy for each other and things go wrong,

00:55:38.575 --> 00:55:40.175
Seong Jae could go completely off the rails.

00:55:44.655 --> 00:55:47.015
So we can't let this drag on for too long.

00:55:48.085 --> 00:55:49.885
After the end of the year, you go have a talk with her.

00:55:50.855 --> 00:55:52.955
She seems like the reasonable type. I'm sure she'll understand.

00:55:54.965 --> 00:55:57.395
Okay. I'll take care of it.

00:56:02.035 --> 00:56:03.605
Everything's all set over there.

00:56:06.805 --> 00:56:07.805
Got it.

00:56:09.345 --> 00:56:10.445
How are you feeling?

00:56:17.345 --> 00:56:18.485
I'm excited.

00:56:20.255 --> 00:56:21.785
The order we agreed on...

00:56:22.755 --> 00:56:23.885
Don't forget.

00:56:25.495 --> 00:56:27.725
Hey, have you forgotten how smart I am?

00:56:32.035 --> 00:56:34.605
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

00:56:38.405 --> 00:56:40.235
- Hello. - Welcome.

00:56:41.505 --> 00:56:43.445
- Su Jeong. - Ms. Jeong.

00:56:44.145 --> 00:56:45.415
It's good to see you, Mother.

00:56:46.615 --> 00:56:47.615
Hello.

00:56:47.645 --> 00:56:51.485
Su Jeong recommended a great place. I didn't realize it was your place.

00:56:52.055 --> 00:56:53.385
Did she?

00:56:54.855 --> 00:56:55.855
When did I ever say that?

00:56:56.755 --> 00:56:58.955
So, where should we sit?

00:56:59.825 --> 00:57:03.325
Hey, Gang Oh. Seat your sister's coworkers.

00:57:03.365 --> 00:57:04.995
- One moment. - Okay.

00:57:05.335 --> 00:57:07.695
- Here you go. - It's a work dinner. Where is she?

00:57:08.365 --> 00:57:09.835
She said she had other plans.

00:57:12.175 --> 00:57:13.835
Where should we sit?

00:57:14.775 --> 00:57:16.105
You can sit right here.

00:57:16.505 --> 00:57:17.605
Thanks.

00:57:21.915 --> 00:57:23.115
Su Jeong, here.

00:57:23.515 --> 00:57:24.655
Thank you.

00:57:25.685 --> 00:57:27.985
Here are the extra ribs you ordered.

00:57:28.625 --> 00:57:31.495
We keep running into each other in places we shouldn't.

00:57:31.855 --> 00:57:32.925
It's so obvious what you're up to.

00:57:35.095 --> 00:57:36.225
What are you talking about?

00:57:36.465 --> 00:57:37.895
That was the point. I came here to be obvious.

00:57:38.495 --> 00:57:40.995
You're pretty sharp. Clearly, you're Eun Oh's brother.

00:57:43.335 --> 00:57:44.775
Round one goes to Ji Hyuk.

00:57:44.835 --> 00:57:47.505
You two are a lot alike, personality-wise.

00:57:48.945 --> 00:57:51.375
- What? - What?

00:57:53.075 --> 00:57:55.485
I wanted to give you more on the house,

00:57:55.485 --> 00:57:57.285
but you already ordered more.

00:57:57.285 --> 00:57:59.385
Don't worry. We can finish it all, Mother.

00:57:59.455 --> 00:58:01.555
I came here specifically for your famous galbi.

00:58:01.825 --> 00:58:02.985
You did?

00:58:03.225 --> 00:58:04.695
He's a bottomless pit.

00:58:04.695 --> 00:58:07.095
Back in college, when we'd go on club trips,

00:58:07.095 --> 00:58:09.595
you'd send us some through Eun Oh, remember?

00:58:10.895 --> 00:58:13.535
I still haven't forgotten that taste.

00:58:13.865 --> 00:58:17.735
That's right. He ate so much we barely got any.

00:58:18.375 --> 00:58:21.075
If I'd known, I would've sent more.

00:58:26.775 --> 00:58:29.545
Looks like you can have them whenever you want now, Mr. Lee.

00:58:29.545 --> 00:58:31.385
I guess I can!

00:58:31.615 --> 00:58:33.815
Mother, you've just found yourself a new regular.

00:58:34.055 --> 00:58:38.355
- My gosh. Thank you so much. - Yes. It's really delicious.

00:58:38.595 --> 00:58:40.295
My sister's going to get a kick out of this.

00:58:42.995 --> 00:58:44.295
I'm home.

00:58:44.795 --> 00:58:45.795
Eun Oh.

00:58:46.035 --> 00:58:48.135
Mom, how come you closed up so early?

00:58:48.535 --> 00:58:50.265
We ran out of ingredients early.

00:58:51.035 --> 00:58:52.705
You must be tired. It sounds like you were busy.

00:58:52.735 --> 00:58:56.645
Actually, your coworkers came for a work dinner today.

00:58:56.805 --> 00:58:58.645
You should have given me a heads-up.

00:58:59.175 --> 00:59:00.175
What?

00:59:00.515 --> 00:59:02.385
Why would they have the work dinner at our restaurant?

00:59:03.615 --> 00:59:06.515
I told them I couldn't make it because I had to visit Woo Jin.

00:59:06.985 --> 00:59:09.385
Su Jeong recommended our restaurant, apparently.

00:59:10.625 --> 00:59:12.125
Su Jeong did?

00:59:13.495 --> 00:59:15.995
Recommended it? Don't be silly. When the CEO tells his staff to go,

00:59:15.995 --> 00:59:18.635
they have no choice but to follow along.

00:59:19.195 --> 00:59:21.865
That CEO really ran up the bill before he left.

00:59:23.365 --> 00:59:24.565
He did?

00:59:32.975 --> 00:59:34.345
Being so on edge,

00:59:35.315 --> 00:59:38.115
I guess I ate way too much. I feel sick to my stomach.

00:59:46.425 --> 00:59:48.865
It's a good thing I won you over back then.

00:59:48.865 --> 00:59:50.925
Where would I be if I hadn't married you?

00:59:51.195 --> 00:59:54.295
What are you talking about? You were just blinded by love.

00:59:54.365 --> 00:59:55.705
So I'm the one who lucked out.

00:59:56.535 --> 00:59:57.665
Oh, please...

00:59:58.505 --> 01:00:00.175
Yeong Ra, what's up?

01:00:01.575 --> 01:00:05.575
I was just coming down for some tea. You just look so happy, Dad.

01:00:07.045 --> 01:00:08.145
I do?

01:00:08.845 --> 01:00:10.715
Come on, sit down. Have some tea with us.

01:00:10.915 --> 01:00:15.085
Oh, no. I wanted it to be just the two of us.

01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:18.225
What, are you jealous of our daughter?

01:00:18.425 --> 01:00:21.765
Yes. Because you're my number one.

01:00:30.465 --> 01:00:32.635
I'm the architect of this whole plan.

01:00:35.575 --> 01:00:36.675
But I'm your big brother.

01:00:37.075 --> 01:00:38.745
Does he have a girlfriend?

01:00:39.345 --> 01:00:41.075
I couldn't protect you before,

01:00:42.745 --> 01:00:44.415
and now I'm the one who needs your help.

01:00:45.715 --> 01:00:46.715
Han Woo Jin.

01:00:47.485 --> 01:00:49.385
We agreed we wouldn't do this.

01:00:49.925 --> 01:00:52.655
I told you. Just forget that we're twins.

01:00:53.225 --> 01:00:54.325
For us,

01:00:55.195 --> 01:00:57.625
the moment we acknowledge we're related by blood,

01:00:57.925 --> 01:01:00.395
it'll be hard to escape her shadow.

01:01:01.095 --> 01:01:02.265
Twins?

01:01:04.465 --> 01:01:06.405
So it turns out she had a twin daughter, too.

01:01:08.035 --> 01:01:09.405
Poor Dad.

01:01:09.845 --> 01:01:11.815
Poor Woo Jin, too.

01:01:12.715 --> 01:01:14.175
And poor Seong Jae.

01:01:15.745 --> 01:01:16.745
And what about me?

01:01:31.865 --> 01:01:33.365
- Mom. - Yes?

01:01:33.365 --> 01:01:36.435
Do you still have that notebook with the store's startup costs?

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:37.965
Can I borrow it?

01:01:42.945 --> 01:01:44.375
What's up with Yeong Ra today?

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:47.475
She's been sitting there doing nothing for a while now.

01:01:49.115 --> 01:01:50.115
Hey!

01:01:51.885 --> 01:01:55.725
You weren't doing anything, so I was just checking on you.

01:01:58.395 --> 01:02:00.355
I need to go meet someone,

01:02:00.725 --> 01:02:02.525
but I don't want to tell you who it is yet.

01:02:06.595 --> 01:02:09.635
All right. I'll just give you a ride, then?

01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:11.605
I already called a cab.

01:02:11.975 --> 01:02:15.045
Why did you call a cab? I'm right here.

01:02:15.475 --> 01:02:16.905
Just make sure I get in okay.

01:02:18.975 --> 01:02:23.015
Hey. Still, you should at least tell me who you're meeting.

01:02:23.015 --> 01:02:26.085
This is a serious breach of my security duty.

01:02:27.115 --> 01:02:29.255
I told you. I don't want to talk about it yet.

01:02:29.485 --> 01:02:30.925
I'll get back on my own, too.

01:02:47.535 --> 01:02:49.605
Hi, can I help you?

01:02:50.045 --> 01:02:54.945
This is the right address, but the sign out front says AP.

01:02:55.715 --> 01:02:58.585
Is Eunoism located here, too, by any chance?

01:03:00.155 --> 01:03:01.955
This money I got...

01:03:02.685 --> 01:03:05.025
The 20,000 dollars from Mom...

01:03:06.125 --> 01:03:07.755
And if I break into my savings...

01:03:10.225 --> 01:03:11.325
Yes?

01:03:19.675 --> 01:03:20.735
Hello.

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:26.515
What brings you here?

01:03:27.675 --> 01:03:29.545
I came to see my sister.

01:03:31.185 --> 01:03:32.285
Your sister?

01:03:33.215 --> 01:03:36.255
Don't we have the same mother?

01:03:37.555 --> 01:03:38.825
Ko Seong Hui.

01:04:24.505 --> 01:04:26.975
(Our Golden Days)

01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:30.305
Seong Jae! How dare you make a move on our Su Bin, you punk?

01:04:30.305 --> 01:04:33.675
He's divorced. And there's a nine-year age gap.

01:04:33.815 --> 01:04:35.845
Seriously, how could they even have a romance?

01:04:35.945 --> 01:04:39.285
Do you have any idea what nonsense you're spouting?

01:04:39.355 --> 01:04:42.225
It's really over. Yes!

01:04:42.755 --> 01:04:46.425
You keep saying "your mom," but she's your mother, too.

01:04:46.495 --> 01:04:48.125
Did your mother put you up to this?

01:04:48.195 --> 01:04:51.465
How can you say such a thing? Does your mom know too?

01:04:51.625 --> 01:04:53.135
Where did you hide Woo Jin?

01:04:53.435 --> 01:04:55.905
So you're the one who put these weird ideas in his head.
