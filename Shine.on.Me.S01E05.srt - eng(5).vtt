00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.680
Sure, we were supposed to verify it,

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.080
but your department

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.120
also had one person prepare

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.000
and another review it.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.900
How did you miss it then?

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.320
You were the ones
who signed the contract.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.620
If you couldn't catch the error,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.920
why should it fall entirely on us?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.240
Who's really responsible

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.660
for the original mistake?

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.400
Don't get worked up.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.200
You're not the one who did the books.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.320
Why are you so stressed?

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.500
Whoever did it takes the heat.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.940
Isn't the name on the stamp

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.560
Nie Xiguang?

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.860
Who's that?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.780
Never heard of her.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.600
Must be a newbie.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.440
I...

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.600
I was the one who actually handled it.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.440
Nie just started here

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.300
and is still learning the ropes.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.160
I just used her stamp

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.880
to process it.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:42.680
Dou Cheng,

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:43.980
when you were begging us

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.540
to rush the order that day,

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.160
didn't you see her then?

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.000
Stop playing these dirty games.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.280
I'm Nie Xiguang.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.960
I'll take full responsibility

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.840
for Finance's part,

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.440
but for errors made at the source

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.020
that have nothing to do with us,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.480
I'm absolutely not taking the blame.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.660
You'll own it?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.260
As if you even could.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.060
Your entire annual salary

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.520
is nothing compared to what we lost.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.460
Are you serious?

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.380
Stop acting so heroic.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.660
What we just saw

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.840
was the module production line.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.180
Up ahead is the cell production line.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.800
Tech and the lab

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:14.980
are also in the cell plant.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.900
Let me show you.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.120
Is that half-finished building
over there

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.740
the Phase II plant?

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.600
Yes.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.540
It's been sitting unfinished
for a long time.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.560
The path for the PV industry

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.280
has been incredibly bumpy.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.880
This company

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.980
was founded in 2005.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.240
The first three years were the only time
everything went right.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.420
In those days,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.780
output value was soaring,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.740
and annual profits
topped a hundred million.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.700
Then came 2008,

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.680
and the financial crisis hit.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.620
We barely managed to scrape by.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.600
Things only looked up for two years

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.600
before the AD/CVD duties hit.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.640
That wiped out our entire market share

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.980
in both Europe and the U.S.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.220
We were among the lucky ones.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.620
A few domestic orders kept us afloat.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.740
But so many others
have declared bankruptcy

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.400
and been forced out of the industry.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.240
The state of the PV market these years

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:04.960
has been tense indeed.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.360
Mr. Zhang, holding the fort
all by yourself

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.440
is no small feat.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:10.700
Before my transfer here,

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.840
my grandpa specifically told me

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:12.920
to learn as much as possible from you.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.120
It's not that I'm anything special.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.480
I've just been cautious
and conservative.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.980
Ever since 2010,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.700
I've strictly controlled our capacity,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.160
and we stopped hiring as well.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.200
This year, due to poor performance,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.140
some staff in Administration

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.160
have left.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.000
Out of necessity, we hired

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.280
a few fresh graduates to fill the gaps.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.840
Hiring during a time like this

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.620
is quite rare in this industry.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.620
Yusen,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.840
I heard

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.540
you volunteered to transfer here

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.460
from HQ.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:40.820
That's right.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:41.960
Why is that?

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.660
I remember

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.240
last year,

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.360
at the corporate strategy session

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.200
on the Phase II expansion project,

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.920
you and I

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.600
both voted against it.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.320
I think we're on the same page.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.980
It's not the expansion you're against,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.700
but the timing.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.300
I asked

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.240
to be sent here

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.460
because I believe

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.340
the turning point has arrived.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.660
Tell me about it.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.800
So, you're putting me on the spot.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.160
If you look at

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.660
the trajectory of global PV,

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.360
from the U.S.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.360
Million Solar Roofs Initiative

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.820
or Germany's

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:20.860
Renewable Energy Sources Act,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.260
the PV momentum

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.480
has always come from the top down.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.280
It's all part

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.200
of the global energy play.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.500
For China,

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.160
developing clean energy

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.120
and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:32.940
is necessary

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.880
and a national imperative.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.560
Giving up is not an option.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.640
The government just released

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.660
a series of PV development roadmaps.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.620
The signal is crystal clear.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.420
They're pivoting to the domestic market.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.880
So, you're here

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.520
because HQ's intent

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.840
is to resume the expansion?

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.420
Exactly.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.660
HQ will release the Phase III funding

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.580
as soon as possible,

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.800
but any further shortfall

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.060
must be self-funded.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.400
Mr. Zhang,

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.120
has the second payment

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.760
from Yuancheng cleared?

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.240
Not yet.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.720
This is Tech.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.120
Mr. Zhang.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.540
Where's Mr. Hua?

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:24.700
He's in the lab.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.540
He'll be here any minute.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.340
Mr. Zhang.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.340
Let me introduce everyone.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:31.620
This is

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.680
our new Deputy GM,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.040
Mr. Lin Yusen.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.600
This is Mr. Hua Xiangyang,

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.460
who holds a PhD

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.680
from the School of Photovoltaic

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.400
and Renewable Energy Engineering
at UNSW Sydney

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.160
and

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:41.760
he leads our R&D

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.140
on PERC technology.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:45.780
Hello.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.500
Sorry.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.640
I was fixing some equipment.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.440
No problem.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.500
Is the machine down again?

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.280
Just a minor glitch.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.080
It's still holding up after a quick fix.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.160
I was actually looking for you.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.460
We've had

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.380
a minor breakthrough
in conversion efficiency,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.500
but

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.060
we're still struggling
to keep it stable.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.480
Even a minor breakthrough

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.940
is great news.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:12.500
Come on.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.720
Let's check it out at the lab.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.520
Let's go.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:21.560
Mr. Lin,

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.000
Finance and Procurement

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.960
have a massive screw-up on their hands.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.040
They are having a total meltdown.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.780
If you want

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.820
our cooperation, fine,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.560
you need to send an email,

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.280
stating clearly:

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.300
"Due to a blunder by Finance,
a payment was issued incorrectly.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.240
Procurement is now being requested

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.280
to step in
and coordinate with the vendor."

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.440
And we need to be clear

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.160
that the fund recovery

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.760
isn't

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.500
our job.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.360
What do you mean,

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.780
it's not your job?

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.740
Are you just going

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.400
to dodge the blame?

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.100
Hello?

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.420
Got it.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:00.860
Stop it, everyone.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.880
This has escalated

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.580
all the way to Mr. Lin.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.400
Don't panic.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.940
Now that the higher-up is involved,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.340
it'll get sorted out.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.560
Hello?

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.300
That's great.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.440
Thanks a lot.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.440
Understood.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.020
Mr. Wang from Administration said

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.200
Mr. Lin reached out

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.120
to the company

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.180
and managed to get the money back.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.380
They've agreed

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.560
to wire the funds by tomorrow.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.440
He also mentioned

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.180
that we're expected

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:49.960
at the Administration immediately.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.840
Mr. Lin wants to see us.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.100
The balding guy in there

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.560
is Mr. Mo, the Head of Procurement.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.480
Mr. Lin called him in, too?

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.100
He seems to have quite an attitude

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.420
and doesn't have much respect
for Mr. Lin.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.160
He used to be at the Shengyuan HQ.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.040
He's been here
since Shuangyuan was first set up.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.200
We've been through three Deputy GMs

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.080
and he's the only one who stayed.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.100
He's a real veteran around here.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.920
Word is, he has serious backing at HQ.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:33.820
Qiqi,

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.820
you're about to be promoted
to Senior Accountant.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.620
If Mr. Lin asks,

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.600
just tell him

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.380
I did the books.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:41.920
No.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.620
You're still on probation.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.880
What if Mr. Lin gets upset

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.120
and fires you?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.960
I'm not afraid.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.040
Xiguang,

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.720
I know you mean well,

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.440
but we have to be honest,

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:52.880
right?

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.840
We'll just tell the truth.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.060
That's the only way
to have a clear conscience.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.160
Where is Mr. Wu?

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:15.060
Mr. Wu is away on a business trip today.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.500
He's already been briefed
on the situation

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:17.599
and is on his way back now.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.980
Tell him

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:22.339
to keep his eyes peeled

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.420
when hiring.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.660
Look at these people

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.400
he brought in.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:26.640
What a total liability.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.240
If Mr. Lin hadn't stepped in

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.700
and got that money back,

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.720
you couldn't pay for this mess
even if we sold you off.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.340
There was an oversight on my part,

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.200
but you guys

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.300
made the error first

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.640
and pushed us to rush the payment.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.880
My apologies, Mr. Mo.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.040
We'll be more careful.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.100
How dare you

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.220
talk to Mr. Mo like that?

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:45.940
Just a reminder,

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.320
Mr. Mo,

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.980
human trafficking is a crime.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.680
Mr. Lin.

Still in the mood for jokes.

You're too young,

and frankly, a medical degree

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.440
hardly prepares you

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.000
for real-world management.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.840
With entry-level staff like these,

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.640
you have to be firm with them.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:05.960
A few more years in the trenches,

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.100

Mr. Lin will be

he'd come after you.

would look out for us.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.780
he likes her?

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.480
Totally.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.640
Cooking for someone
is the ultimate love language.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.680
It's so sweet.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.360
I love it.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.500
But in reality,

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.200
maybe he just didn't want her

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.680
to treat him to a big meal

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.340
and would rather do it himself

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.120
than owe her a favor.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.660
He's the standoffish type, huh?

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.260
So

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.760
delusion is a disease,

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.360
and it seriously needs the cure.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:15.860
I've decided,

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.280
once this project is wrapped up,

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:18.380
I'm taking some time off.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.360
I thought you were taking time off.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.480
What are you doing now,

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.380
pulling overtime?

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.380
I'm putting together

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.199
a deluxe spreadsheet

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.159
that will blow my ex-ally's mind

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.100
and get my vacation approved.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.620
I've gathered historical quotes

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.000
from various suppliers for every product

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.900
via phone and email.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.100
Since you might need

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.500
to keep this confidential,

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.460
I made the calls from my personal phone.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.380
My number is registered in Wuxi,

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.120
so they won't

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.260
link it back to us.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.540
For the emails, I made up

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.300
a fake company based in Jiangxi.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.720
In the sheet,

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.700
I also entered

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.760
our average transaction prices

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.660
over the years.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.160
Any price variance over 10%

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.140
is highlighted in red.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.440
You've been very thorough.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.900
Excellent work.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:36.740
Thanks, Mr. Lin.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.060
Mr. Lin,

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.800
I'd like to request some time off.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:43.820
[Leave Request Form]

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.380
Three days?

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.000
Why such a long leave?

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.260
Because...

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.060
I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.360
Unfortunately,

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.820
I used to be a doctor

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.160
and I really don't see

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.780
any signs of illness.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.300
Were you a TCM doctor?

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.120
I mean, only TCM doctors

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.200
can diagnose just by looking.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.420
Request denied.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:23.840
You may leave.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:40.820
How did it go?

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.620
Did your "ex-ally" drop his jaw?

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.180
Are you a TCM doctor?

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.380
No.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:50.800
Have you lost your mind?

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.600
Would saying that

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.860
make you angry?

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.880
Why would I be mad?

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.060
At most,

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.840
I'd just think you've lost it.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:00.820
Exactly.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.240
He was being so weird.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.220
It was like someone stepped on his tail.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.320
Who are you talking about?

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.170
[Leave Request Form]

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.460
I mean

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.900
I'd better keep my head down
for a few days.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.880
I think I've reached my breaking point.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.320
I need to go out
for a real meal tomorrow.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.920
How come you hit your "limit"
every three days?

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:34.920
Wait.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.860
Just make do with this dorm for now.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:37.960
Your uncle

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.780
has pulled some strings for you.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:39.820
They'll try their best not to assign you

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:40.460
any roommates.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:41.600
Come on,

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:42.400
let's go.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.680
What's going on?

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.280
Someone new just moved into Building 1.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:52.840
Dorm Management promised us

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.180
that we'd get

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.540
the first available room.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.320
I've got the scoop.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.980
The guy who moved
into Building 1 yesterday

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.200
is a new hire in Procurement.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.480
A room opened up in Building 1,

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.560
and he just moved right in.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:28.740
What gives?

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.360
Shouldn't we have been prioritized?

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.460
We've been here longer.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.020
This is totally unfair.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:33.740
No way.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:34.900
I'm going to file a formal complaint.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.640
A complaint probably won't do any good.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.400
Word is, he's a relative

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.300
of Mr. Mo from Procurement.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.120
Procurement again?

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.240
Mr. Mo is way too full of himself.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.780
Exactly.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.900
So what if he's a relative?

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.660
Rules are rules, right?

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:51.960
Logistics

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.300
will definitely back him up.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.480
Even if we complain,

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.420
they'll probably just stall

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.540
and give us the runaround.

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.640
I heard the cafeteria caterer

00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.980
is also a crony he brought in.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.840
No wonder the food is so terrible.

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.540
Old hatreds and new resentments.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:07.980
No,

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.480
we can't just let this slide.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.980
Should we just go straight to Mr. Lin?

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.400
Mr. Lin?

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.100
Yeah.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.700
Mr. Lin outranks Mr. Mo

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.260
and he is not afraid of him.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.060
Besides, Yin Jie and I
are in Administration,

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.340
and Yuhua, you're in Marketing.

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.820
Both departments report directly to him.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:31.720
Who else are we supposed to go to?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.960
But what if Mr. Lin resents us

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.780
for causing trouble

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.820
and putting him in a spot?

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.340
You have a point.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.160
If Mr. Lin thinks

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.300
we're being immature and reckless,

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.420
then we're screwed.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:43.540
True.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.200
I guess I wasn't thinking it through.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:53.800
Listen.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:55.820
Forget

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:56.880
about the complaint form.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.140
I'll go talk to Mr. Lin alone.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.040
I don't care if he has
a bad impression of me.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.200
Anyway,

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.180
it's already as bad as it gets.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.280
Don't.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.560
You shouldn't just

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.580
throw in the towel like that.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.500
Either we go together

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.520
or no one goes at all.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:10.520
You hear me?

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.280
Yeah.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:24.760
Ke,

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.140
here you go.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.020
What kind of meeting lasts this long?

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:53.600
Mr. Lin.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.280
I'll head back

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.380
and touch base with Mr. Ba

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.120
at Shengyuan Finance.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:04.400
Mr. Lin.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.500
