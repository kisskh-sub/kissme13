[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.100
Your identity is no longer hidden.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.410
What do you mean to do with

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.930
those two disciples of yours?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.820
The fact that we are still alive

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.330
is nothing but fortune.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.620
I trust you will not betray us.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.050
And that is because your children

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.020
rest in the heavens,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.620
watching over you.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.940
Someone kind crossed paths with you.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.100
They even set polished rice

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.870
before an ownerless memorial tablet.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.920
Chang'an

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.880
is indeed a place of deep prosperity.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.010
We have reached the final brink.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.730
Soon children,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.780
our answer will come soon.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.290
30 years have passed.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.480
When Chang'an falls,

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.100
even in the winter,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.240
the people of Tiemo will have

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.660
more grain than they could ever finish.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.570
If only you could have been born in such times,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.290
how good that would have been.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.380
[Episode 22]

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.780
These past few days I have felt something is wrong.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.740
Huai'an has not returned.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.540
Around the Taiyiji Clinic,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.050
there have been many unfamiliar faces.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.730
All of this was arranged by you.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.050
Why?

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.810
Master.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.250
If you mean to kill me,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.130
at least let me die knowing why.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.680
It is a simple truth.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.200
The people of Tiemo have entered the city.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.730
I am Tiemo as well.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.710
Every Tiemo shadow guard in the city

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.080
is searching for Xie Huai'an.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.780
He is capable,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.340
and he vanished without a trace.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.410
Fortunately I have you two.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.020
He has very few friends.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.930
For your sake,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.170
he would do anything foolish.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.290
Xiaoqing's life is hanging by a thread.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.660
Do not resist.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.540
Take her away quickly,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.590
and heal her wounds.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.790
Master.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.380
Xiaoqing.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.320
Master.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.040
Xiaoqing.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.190
What happened to you?

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.420
It hurts.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.610
Do not be afraid.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.060
I am here.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.830
You can only return to the Taiyiji Clinic.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.810
There are many of our people on Xiaocaomen Street.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.810
They will look after you both.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.610
Master.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.600
Must it truly be this way?

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.820
For the great cause of Tiemo,

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.980
the lives of a child or two taken in

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.370
are not worth much.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.130
Xiaoqing.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.900
Let us go home.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.490
Xiaoqing.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.250
Hold on.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.170
We are almost at the clinic.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.900
Do not worry.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.460
I will heal you, I promise.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.460
The wounds can be mended.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.580
But what of the heart?

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.670
I will kill him for you.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.020
And Master?

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.100
Will you kill him too?

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.520
You collapsed before Gu Yu's grave.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.050
Our people carried you back.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.150
How many days has it been?

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:24.850
Four days.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.260
The physician examined you.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.900
He said you did not faint from injury

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:31.570
but fell asleep.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.570
Four days.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.300
News of Gu Yu's death

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.570
must have reached the north by now.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.840
The death of a general

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.930
can shake an army's resolve.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.380
The Baiwenhu Army

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.730
may not hold.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.810
Now that the Tiemo forces march south,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.930
what of Chang'an

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.180
as it stands today?

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.780
Yesterday,

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.250
Tiemo troops breached the North Office.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.060
The North Office

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.530
is only 1300 li from Chang'an.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.510
The Huben Army excels

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.130
at gathering intelligence.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.190
Nothing that happens in Chang'an

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.960
escapes your eyes.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.770
Tell me,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.300
my friends...

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.670
Are they all dead?

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.710
I fear

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.060
they may wish they were.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:44.820
Good.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.580
If so,

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.110
then they are still alive.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.700
And if they live, there is hope.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.300
My pageboy...

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.770
Where is he now?

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.760
You are...

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.240
Have we met before?

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.210
The last time we met

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.550
was 15 years ago.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.340
Back then you were a young prince

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.340
of Chang'an,

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.940
studying at the Grand Academy.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.130
To escape your lessons,

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.370
you often claimed to be ill.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.320
You are...

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.920
After all these years,

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.010
there is something I have always wondered.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.010
The gift I gave you...

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.010
Did you ever use it?

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.220
I have a gift for you.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.460
Mentor.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.060
Wu Zhongheng?

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.300
It is me.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.220
Who are you, truly?

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.600
Xie Huai'an did not have time to tell you,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.540
I suppose.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.010
I am Tiemo.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.650
All of Chang'an speaks of Gu Yu's death.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.080
Yes.

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.530
I was the one who killed him.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.060
Do not be alarmed.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.280
I will not kill you.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.300
Let us sit,

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.250
and speak of old times.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.410
Come. Sit.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:21.770
You...

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.130
How long have you been hiding?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.820
More than 20 years.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.420
I traveled across

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.300
your entire land,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.100
then spent a few more years

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.250
building a reputation,

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.080
befriending the powerful.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.580
Liu Ziwen, Yan Fengshan,

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.850
Grand Preceptor Cen Weizong,

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.410
even your father

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.300
were all friends of mine.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.540
During my years at the Grand Academy,

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.330
I saw for myself

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.930
the brightest talents of Chang'an.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.200
Xie Huai'an,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.130
Gu Yu,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.570
and your elder brother,

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.430
Xiao Wuyang.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.560
And you

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.090
were the most timid of them all.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.540
You are not the first to say that about me.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.190
Once,

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.110
Yan Fengshan said the same thing.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.180
Do not pity yourself.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.380
Because it is precisely your timidity

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.090
that makes you

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.210
the ideal candidate for the throne.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.680
Many who hold power think so.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.730
And so do

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.900
the faraway people of Tiemo,

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.350
those who serve at the altar on Mount Shiluoman.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.710
You see,

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.470
timidity can sometimes be

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:44.810
a means of survival.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.040
It allows you to live

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.640
far longer than most.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.540
Take Gu Yu,

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.730
a man who always charged to the front.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.730
Men like him only die first.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.010
By the way,

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.670
was it

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.160
Xie Huai'an's idea to send you away?

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.760
You were born into the imperial line,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.980
yet you scare so easily.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.440
Yan Fengshan kept you under his thumb for years.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.660
The throne slipped from your grasp long ago.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.550
But in the great city of Chang'an,

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.500
he is hardly the only one

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.060
who wants to become another Yan Fengshan.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.640
Whoever grows powerful

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.360
will try to control you.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.240
And this truth

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.010
is something Xie Huai'an certainly understands.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.580
He should have killed you the moment he had you

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:57.570
under control.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.560
If peace is what he wanted,

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.010
your death

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.830
would have settled everything.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.890
He is more human

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.130
than you or Yan Fengshan.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.190
Indeed.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.650
You threw snakes at him back then,

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.900
yet he can still call you a friend.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.090
He truly has a kindness that serves him little.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.490
When I entered Chang'an,

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.420
my first move against the Huben Army

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.660
was to give him a new face

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.660
and a forged identity,

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.290
fooling everyone.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.420
Even Yan Fengshan

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:54.830
might never have guessed it.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.010
What I did not expect

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:05.330
was that this plan

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.780
would be uncovered by the King of Tiemo.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.570
Zhu Zhilong is Tiemo as well.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.220
It turns out

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.430
they had infiltrated us

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.490
long before we knew it.

00:18:22.215 --> 00:18:34.215
(Watch on dramacool.club to support Admin)

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.250
My poor friends, both of them.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.900
I want to go out.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.700
Do you know where you are?

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.490
Of course I do.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.690
This is my sister's home.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.580
The pear tree in the courtyard

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.380
was planted by her own hand.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.090
To me,

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.860
this is where the general lived

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.200
and where he died.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.810
Perhaps people like us

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.770
are fated

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.860
to choose in the midst of chaos

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.000
between vengeance

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:57.600
and duty to the realm.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:00.860
You do not need to choose.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.330
I have already given you my word.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.180
When the Tiemo are defeated,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.220
you may come to settle your debt with me at any time.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.070
And in doing so,

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.980
you will honor the Huben Army

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.800
and General Fengshan.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:33.940
With the general gone,

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.010
the Huben I can command is limited.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.520
But if you fight the Tiemo,

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.450
I will help you.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.460
For now,

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.700
I need time to think.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.250
I said

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.800
I want to go out for a walk.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.380
Before he died, Yan Fengshan said

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.040
that the streets of Chang'an

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.980
might offer a different view.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.050
Then tomorrow,

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.420
walk around Chang'an.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.610
Chang'an

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.290
can be beautiful at times.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.560
Steamed buns.

An army may fall to the last man.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:00.580
But Chang'an

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.050
must not fall.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.260

This is Gu Yu's

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.090
battle report

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.280
that he hid inside his body.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.220
Once you read it,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.110
you will know where you must go.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.230
Right now my friends' fate is unknown

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.430
and I have no one else to trust,

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.830
so I can only leave it in your hands.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.030
But if you have other plans,

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.370
you are free to choose another path.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.560
But I fear that Chang'an

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.070
can no longer be held.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.180
I will deliver this

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.010
to where it must go.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:08.940
Thank you.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.180
Is there any news of Xiao Wuyang?

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:25.580
There has been no word at all.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:28.970
What are you planning to do?

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:32.640
You mean to head north.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.240
Gu Yu is dead.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:35.540
I have no allies

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.660
left to rely on.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.230
The deposed emperor and Ye Zheng

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.430
are both in their hands.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.850
The Tiemo people are waiting for me.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.330
This is the only road left to me.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:51.940
I will go to the Tiemo,

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.420
and help them kill Xiao Wuyang.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.380
In the imperial court,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.290
the ones the Tiemo fear most

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.770
are Yan Fengshan and Xiao Wuyang.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.770
Now that Yan Fengshan is dead,

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.980
our only chance

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.580
lies with Xiao Wuyang.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.080
You should go.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:09.770
And you

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:11.680
had better not die.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:13.980
You owe no life to the Tiemo.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.700
You owe it to General Fengshan.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.220
I owe him nothing.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.250
Go.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.070
Take care.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:51.250
Father.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.940
I failed to protect my sister.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.220
No one walks away

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:01.860
unscathed

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.600
after facing Yan Fengshan.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.370
You guarded her all these years

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:08.900
and did everything you could.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:10.990
In the end,

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.670
you even avenged her.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.310
Do not be so hard on yourself.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.700
Seeing my son

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.440
so weak and worn

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.540
breaks my heart.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.370
A father

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.370
always aches for his child.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:34.940
Since you came to Chang'an,

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.370
you have already lost too much.
(Watch on www.kisskh .ws to support Admin)

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.890
Then take the red ribbon down.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:44.600
Father.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:47.730
Though our family's vengeance is repaid,

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:50.810
Chang'an

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.580
is far from peaceful.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.050
I waited all night.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:19.810
I only wished to tell you one thing, Father.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.330
The King of Tiemo has arrived in Chang'an.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.090
Then take the red ribbon down.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:47.700
Very well.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:28.780
Everything is done.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.460
Only then did I dare come before Your Majesty.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:32.660
Xie Huai'an's friends

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.700
can no longer escape.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.530
We need only wait for him to appear.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.940
White Hair entered Yan Fengshan's courtyard.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.330
I cannot tell whether he won or lost,

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.820
so I sent you in.

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.420
For that,

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.500
you had to kill the master you served for years.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:55.130
Do you regret it?

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.780
No.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.220
I have only ever served one master with my life.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.430
Yan Fengshan is dead.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.850
The Huben Army is no longer a threat.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.470
Gu Yu is dead as well.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.710
Our forces

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:18.050
can march straight into their empire's heartland.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.610
Only one danger remains.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:22.660
Xiao Wuyang.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.570
If he dies,

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.460
Chang'an falls.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.700
Xiao Wuyang stands alone now.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:33.260
This time,

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.290
if our plan is thorough,

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.700
he will not survive.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.710
I saw something like this once,

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:43.180
a man on the edge of death,

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:47.610
hanging high on a platform.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.180
He was an ordinary man,

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:52.290
yet he lived for seven days and nights.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.500
If someone ordinary

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.120
can fight so hard to survive,

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.420
what about the King of Death, Xiao Wuyang?

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.180
Yes.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.890
The noodles are here.

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:10.700
Chili oil noodles.

00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:14.010
Scallions dipped in vinegar.

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:17.490
It has been more than ten years.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:19.100
Sha,

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:21.740
you still remember my favorite bite.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.660
Of course I do.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:26.280
If I ever forgot it,

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:29.020
I would lose my head.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:36.930
Sha,

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.540
Cen Pickles came by, didn't he?

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.540
No.

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:48.370
After the Liu clan was wiped out,

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.290
Yan Fengshan purged Liu's faction,

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.890
and he never showed himself again.

00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:55.700
Does he still need

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.370
to hide from Yan Fengshan's blade?

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:58.540
Don't you also…

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:11.010
Don't you also hide from him?

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:11.660
Unbelievable.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:18.260
Sha,

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.460
that you've survived this long with that temperament

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.490
feels like a miracle to me.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:25.730
Eat while it's hot.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.220
Sha,

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.540
in this world,

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.660
I have patience for very few people.

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:37.100
You are one of them.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.410
Cen Pickles is another.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:42.120
If he came to you,

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.740
and you don't wish to tell me,

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.370
or he forbade you to say,

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.680
it doesn't matter.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.060
Just pass on a message for me.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.890
Tell him I have arrived in Chang'an.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.490
And that I hope

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.330
we are still friends.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.100
Cen Pickles,

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:42.660
who is he?

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:46.450
A man surnamed Cen.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.270
Twenty years ago,

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.970
everyone knew his name.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.780
The Grand Preceptor, Cen Weizong?

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:58.740
He was a friend of His Majesty?

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:05.970
The founding emperor,

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.450
Liu Ziwen,

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.890
the Grand Preceptor Cen Weizong,

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.260
and the man just now,

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:13.080
when they were young,

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.300
often gathered here.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.490
Yan Fengshan

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.180
would sometimes come along too.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:21.910
He was younger

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:22.950
than the rest of them.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.540
And in their eyes,

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:28.540
the so-called General Fengshan

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:30.560
was just

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.930
an inexperienced young man.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.010
An inexperienced young man?

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.100
Later,

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.580
didn't he rule the empire for over ten years?

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:56.260
In your eyes,

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:00.930
I am also

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.780
an inexperienced young man, aren't I?

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.540
You...

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.780
You are not human.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.700
When I had nowhere left to go,

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.930
the boss took me in.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.010
Later,

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.060
I went outside the city to collect his body.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.450
He was crushed to death.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.140
Not even beasts would do such a thing.

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.740
I remember the boss's kindness.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.140
But I was born a Tiemo man.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:34.450
My life was not his to give.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.740
Can I have a bowl of noodles?

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.220
Get out.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:48.580
After more than ten years apart,

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.010
I meet you again.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:58.450
This is Yang Chuhao's courtyard.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.140
Why did you suddenly

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:03.010
decide to sun his books?

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:09.410
In his study,

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.290
there truly are many fine volumes.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.000
I even found

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.920
a travelogue written by a friend

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.290
from my youth.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.100
Reading it

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.490
was like seeing an old friend again.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:25.890
An old friend?

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.260
Then I am also one of your old friends.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.620
Of course.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.740
Back at the Grand Academy I asked you,

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:39.700
when you grew up,

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.930
what kind of achievement you wished for.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:43.720
Do you remember?

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:47.850
Of course I do.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.060
I asked you,

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:51.490
when you grew up,

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.330
what kind of

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:54.620
career you wished to build?

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:55.780
In times of peace,

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.140
to aid a wise ruler.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.220
And in times of chaos?

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.970
In times of chaos,

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.260
to kill every enemy.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:08.890
White Hair,

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:13.220
have you come to kill me?

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.060
Mentor,

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:24.220
these hands of a scholar

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.140
now hold no iron, no blade.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.620
How could they possibly kill the King of Tiemo?

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:32.330
I came

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:35.720
to trade for my friend's life.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.260
You say you came to save a friend,

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.170
but I do not believe

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:42.520
you would surrender quietly.

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:44.580
It has been over ten years,

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.140
and your intellect is enough to chill the bones.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.850
You killed Yan Fengshan with strategy,

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.060
because you understood him.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.740
White Hair,

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:01.180
as for me,

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.370
how well do you understand me?
