00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.610
Brilliant, my foot.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.430
Xiguang,

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:28.930
come on.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.130
Quit it. Let's go.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.090
We're gonna be late.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.850
Thanks.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:38.470
No problem.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:51.970
I know, one bad flight

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.870
and now you're traumatized for life.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.330
But we're taking off soon,
so just relax.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.930
That wasn't just "ordinary" turbulence.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.010
It was an out-of-body,
terrifying experience.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.350
Why don't I feel scared anymore
now that we're in the air?

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.890
You don't get motion sick
and you're not afraid of heights,

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:04.910
so you're just afraid of dying, right?

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:07.170
Look, once we're up there,

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.190
it's all up to fate.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.290
Worrying isn't going to help.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:10.530
Ugh. Why did I ever

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:11.450
agree to your mom

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.490
and come on this trip with you?

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:13.910
I'm taking you on a trip. Seriously?

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.670
Traveling all this way for a view

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.510
is like going to great lengths

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.450
just to chase a relationship.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:24.130
Xiguang,

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.170
be brave

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:26.130
and enjoy the view.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.450
And after you've seen it?

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.690
You'll just walk away?

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.050
What else? Are you supposed
to move in and live there?

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.030
So that's how you treat

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.630
your relationships, right?

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.070
You're such a playboy.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.610
What are you talking about?

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.370
Xiguang, let's take a picture together

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:51.830
to mark the start of our journey.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:53.610
Stop it.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.710
- Stop.
- Come on.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.150
What if this becomes our last photo?

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.470
You're way too old
to be called a "lass" anymore.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.730
Yeah... I suppose.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.250
[Delete]

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.450
This is all your fault.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.190
Told you not to take pictures.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:41.870
Young lady,

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:43.610
you gave me such a scare.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.890
I couldn't catch a wink of sleep
the whole flight.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.450
I am so sorry.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:50.710
Do you need help with your luggage?

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:51.490
No.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:52.590
So sorry again.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:16:59.610
Let's go.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.109
Let's go!

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.990
Come on.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:11.950
Follow me.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:14.270
Hurry up.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:15.329
Let's go.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.150
Let's get a photo together.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:21.510
Come on.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.450
Xiguang,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.290
ever played online games?

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:43.910
Yeah, I have.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:44.630
Then don't you

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.730
feel like a companion pet right now?

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.290
Other pets

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.870
actually help their masters

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.930
pick up loot and stuff.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:51.050
But you?

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.270
You barely even put me in the frame.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.310
That was a fluke.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.070
Check out what I took.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:02.790
You look like a goddess
in every single shot.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:09.390
I don't care.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:10.310
I'm just gonna coast.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:12.030
The Cambridge study program

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.030
doesn't even start until next Monday.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.650
That gives us
three whole days to ourselves.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:15.830
You can be the boss

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:16.750
and plan the itinerary.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.350
Not until Monday?

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:21.310
I knew it. You dragged me here

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.470
way too early on purpose.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.950
Hey, I did it all for you.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.790
For me?

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:26.390
Yeah.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:27.890
I see you're suffering

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.610
from a classic case
of the post-grad blues.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.370
So I thought,

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:33.390
let's just make a break for it

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.490
and get some fresh air.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:36.310
You didn't seem to appreciate

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.510
all the efforts I put in...

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:39.950
What's wrong?

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.430
Xiguang,

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.130
use your words.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:47.010
Don't just tackle me like that.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:47.990
I know this is an emotional moment,

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.770
but you can't just go around

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.570
hugging me like this.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.950
Jiang Rui.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:54.250
Thank you.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.090
Don't be so formal.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:59.190
As long as you're happy, it's worth it.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:04.590
I am happy.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:06.170
Really?

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.810
Yeah.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:12.950
And...

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.870
something just clicked for me.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.850
What is it?

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.390
Well,

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:25.450
in the past few days,

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.010
we've seen so much beautiful scenery.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.170
But no matter how beautiful it is,

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.250
we only get a glimpse
before we have to leave.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.370
I have to

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:36.530
say goodbye

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.310
without looking back,

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.810
because

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:43.150
it doesn't belong to me.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:48.610
Look at you, getting all poetic.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.890
What's the rush?

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:50.990
We're still young.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.290
Someday, we'll have our own

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:53.350
"Real Estate Scenery."

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:54.890
What the heck?

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.350
"Real Estate Scenery"?

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:58.190
Yeah.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:59.330
A view with your name

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.190
written all over it.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.210
Alright then.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.130
I'll take care of the arrangements

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:11.790
for the next few days.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.050
Where to next?

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.390
How about Windermere?

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:17.970
Off we go.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.690
Go.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.350
[Two Months Later]
[Wuxi]

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.150
[Jiang Yun]

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.270
Look at these photos.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.850
You're getting thinner and thinner.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.710
Did you go to Europe to study,

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:30.730
or to lose weight?

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:33.670
You know how terrible

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:34.910
the food is in Europe.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.450
I thought, at the very least,

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:37.750
their cakes

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:38.410
would be decent.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.550
But as it turns out,

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.890
they're so sweet
that even I, a Wuxi native,

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:41.510
couldn't handle it.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.270
Don't worry, though.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:44.750
I'll gain it all back within two weeks.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.070
Don't go on a binge-eating spree.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.890
Just stick to a regular diet.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:51.930
You've been away for two months now.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.550
It's time to settle down

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.410
and get back to work.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.030
The CPA firm called

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:56.790
a couple of days ago

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.170
to ask when you're coming in.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:20:59.230
By the way,

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.870
weren't you saying

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:01.870
you were looking for a job by yourself?

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.030
How's that going?

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.550
One company in Suzhou

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.030
and two or three in Nanjing

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.850
have sent me offers.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.350
But only the Suzhou one said

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:09.550
I could start in September.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:10.510
The others said

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:11.230
they'd let me know

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.210
whenever a position opens up.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.530
What kind of companies are they?

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.270
The companies in Nanjing

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:16.610
are a CPA firm,

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.510
a Fortune 500 multinational,

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.470
and a pharma company.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.450
The one in Suzhou

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.610
is a private manufacturing firm

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:23.670
that makes PV panels.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.210
What's the name

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.330
of the one in Suzhou?

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.130
Shuangyuan
Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.470
That was a company
Yuancheng invested in,

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:34.670
back before your dad and I got divorced.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.410
Yuancheng

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.570
holds a 49% stake,

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.430
and Shengyuan

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:39.790
holds 51%.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:41.450
So,

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.490
it's called "Shuangyuan."
[*Meaning: double "yuan".]

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.390
Oh, by the way,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.430
there is one thing

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:47.930
I need to relay to you.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:50.390
What?

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.210
Don't tell me

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.430
the company in Nanjing

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:55.910
is also partly owned by our family?

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.190
Don't worry.
We don't have that kind of muscle.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.310
While you were in Europe,

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:02.550
your father came to me.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.490
He wants you to work at Yuancheng

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.130
as his successor.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.310
[Yuancheng Group, Wuxi]

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.310
Is the partnership with Shengyuan

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:16.410
dead in the water?

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.970
It's been dragging on for months.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.590
[Nie Chengyuan]
Probably gone.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.590
We were hoping to leverage their brand

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.570
and marketing expertise

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:25.810
to give the property
a more premium positioning.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.190
But once again, Lin Yusen screwed

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.910
everything up.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:29.290
I think we should

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:30.970
stop messing around with them.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.350
Our brand recognition here

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.790
is already pretty high.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.850
Better to rely on ourselves than others.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:36.730
Why don't we just

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.790
focus on building solid quality,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.070
and make a real splash?

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.050
It's not just about this.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:44.790
There was an earlier project,

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:46.370
which also fell through because of him.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:47.830
Nie,

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.330
is there some history between you two?

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.070
I've only run into him
a couple of times at Shengyuan.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.710
Young face.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.990
A real snake.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.830
But he's not the real problem.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.610
Sheng Xianmin doesn't even care

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.710
about his own daughter or son-in-law,

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.410
so why would he give the time of day

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.270
to his grandson?

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:07.210
Then...

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:13.590
Let's call it a day.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.350
Please enjoy.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:17.910
Thank you.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.070
So, you went to Europe,

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:25.410
yet you didn't even

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.790
bring me back a single souvenir?

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.390
I asked you to stop by the office,

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:30.150
and you wouldn't.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.410
It's all going

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.890
to be yours eventually anyway.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:34.170
What's the harm in visiting?

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.370
I'll reimburse you ten times over
for whatever you spent.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.210
I don't want to go to your company

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:55.210
because I don't want to run into
someone I'd rather not see.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.870
What kind of person do you think I am?

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.270
You think I'm that clueless?

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.870
The office is a place of business.

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.350
Not necessarily.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:05.290
It's not like
you haven't done it before.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:11.590
How's your mom doing lately?

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.730
She's great.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:16.770
Haven't you two been on the phone?

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.130
She's acting so dismissive these days,

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.130
always trying to hang up
after just a few words.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.190
That's what happens
when her stock is up.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.250
Who wants to stay on the phone

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.790
with their ex-husbands?

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.830
Mom has plenty of suitors these days.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:31.290
I heard

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.270
someone even chased her all the way
from Nanjing to Wuxi.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.470
At this rate,
she might even get remarried

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.270
before you do.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:38.690
Stop talking nonsense.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:40.170
I told you

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.150
I'm not getting remarried.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.290
That old friend of mine

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.090
is in bad shape.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:47.150
She barely has any time left.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.210
Is it so wrong for me to look after her?

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.570
It's a perfectly innocent friendship,

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:53.530
but your mom just loves chasing shadows

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:54.810
and lets her imagination run wild.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.330
She won't take anything lying down.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.350
Well, your friend's "last few years"

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:00.190
sure have lasted a long time.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.910
How can you talk like that?

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.050
I'm just telling the truth.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:04.190
Years ago,

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.950
you said she didn't have long to live.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.330
Now I've graduated from college

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:08.390
and she still only has a few years?

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.070
What is this, an unlimited refill
on her life?

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:17.750
Is this all you wanted to talk about?

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:19.310
If that's it, I'm off.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.450
Actually, I wanted to talk

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.130
about your work.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.190
You mentioned

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.150
that you sent your résumé to Shengyuan.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:29.550
Now that you're back,

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:30.770
are you getting ready to start?

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.010
I scrapped that plan ages ago.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.510
Why?

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.730
Bad vibes.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:39.750
Going to Shengyuan

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.530
might have taught you a thing or two.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:43.550
But it's just as well you aren't going.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:45.770
Come work here instead.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:47.790
It's time you get familiar with things.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.390
My business

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.590
is going to be yours one day, after all.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.130
Since your mother told you about it,

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.810
that means she's not against the idea.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:02.450
Mom respects me.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:03.970
Even if she were against it,

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:05.330
she would tell me your word.

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:06.330
But I don't want to...

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.930
Xiguang.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:09.410
I'm not as young as I used to be.

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.290
I wouldn't say that.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:11.030
You...

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.010
Xiguang,

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.230
I'm carrying you on my back

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.150
and walking all that way
just to get you KFC.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.190
When I'm old,

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.570
you'd better remember to carry me

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:28.490
for some braised pork.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.410
But it's not like
you're going to shrink.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.110
I can't lug you around.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.470
Then you'll just have to find me

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:36.850
a strapping son-in-law.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.090
What kind of nonsense
are you telling her?

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.330
Things used to be so good.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:08.530
I'm only

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:10.850
listening to Mom on this one.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.250
If she doesn't want me to go,

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:14.510
then I won't.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:16.330
Saying that

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.610
must have driven your father livid.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:19.250
Well, he nearly

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.950
did the same to me back then.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.050
Xiguang,

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.310
if your dad and I

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:26.630
hadn't fallen apart,

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:28.310
and we were still a whole family,

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.170
would you have wanted
to go to Yuancheng then?

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:38.950
Then now I would listen to you both.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.290
Mom,

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:42.810
I feel like

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:45.110
I've just been

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.450
drifting through life,

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:48.190
without

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.190
a clear goal.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:51.870
Does that make you disappointed in me?

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.530
People who have it all figured out
from day one

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:56.750
and stick to their path

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:57.790
without ever wavering

00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:58.990
are a rare breed.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.790
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.970
Xiguang,

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:03.830
I don't want you to work in Yuancheng.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:05.390
Then I won't go.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.910
It's not because I'm being selfish.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:09.610
It's because

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:10.790
I don't want you

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:11.930
caught in the crossfire

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:12.590
of the messy fallout

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.790
between your dad and me.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:15.710
If you go,

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.870
you'll be torn in two

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.110
and be miserable.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:19.590
Maybe one day,

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.270
when you're strong

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:22.650
and mature enough,

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:24.810
we can talk about it then.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.010
Go to Suzhou.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:36.090
Suzhou?

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:36.970
That's right.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:38.450
Whatever happens,

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.710
that's a job you earned all by yourself.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:48.950
Hello, Mr. Song.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:51.050
Please.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.270
We're meeting

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.490
Shengyuan's VP,

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:54.230
Sheng Zhongkai,

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:55.590
and some other execs.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.130
I'll get you some face time.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:58.350
It'll make things

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.350
much easier later on.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:08.090
Mr. Sheng,

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:09.610
it's been a while.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.570
I heard Shengyuan
has big moves in the works.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:12.490
Congratulations!

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.130
It has been a long time.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.030
I was just thinking about you.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:16.010
Have a seat.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:17.270
Aaron from Huifa Bank

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.810
came by a while ago.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.150
He specifically mentioned you,

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.750
saying it was you

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:23.270
who personally showed him the ropes.

I know you're swamped with work,

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:40.990
and didn't have any time
during National Day,

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.170
so I didn't reach out to you.

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:46.590
No, it's fine.

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.330
I'm already back in Suzhou for work.

Anyway, Dad,

I should go.

I need to take care of something.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:00.710
Yin Jie,

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.810
you need to throw this scale away.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:03.490
It's broken.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:07.330
Is it possible

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:08.950
that you just gained weight back home

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:09.670
during the holiday?

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.150
Finance didn't even start the break
until the 2nd.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:14.250
How could I have packed on
two or three kg

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.070
in a matter of days?

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.510
The cafeteria

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:18.490
is to blame for this.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.090
Now you know what I have said before?

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.710
We're gaining weight

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:25.850
not because the food here is good,

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.830
but because it's so darn bad.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.850
It leaves us so unsatisfied

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.710
that we come back and gorge on snacks
and instant noodles,

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:33.330
and then we hit the restaurants
on weekends.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.710
That's exactly how the weight piles on.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:38.650

This place is in the middle of nowhere.

There's no dating life anyway,

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:51.470
so why bother dieting?

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:52.410
Exactly.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.450
Work is such a drag.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:54.290
School was way better.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:55.910
At least school had some variety.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.110
Now it's just dorm-work-repeat.

And the worst part is no eye candy.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:01.870
I've been here for three months

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:03.150
and I haven't seen a single hottie.

Turns out

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:05.710
school is really the place for romance.

Once you're in the real world,

A total class act.

Why give up a career in surgery

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:02.870
to work at a place like this?

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.650
I have no clue about that.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:11.770
Is that a promotion or a demotion?

Well...

None of that matters.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.750
All that matters is that he's hot.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:21.930
But honestly,

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.410

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.630
He must

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.650
be middle-aged by now, right?
