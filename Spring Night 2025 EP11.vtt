Shen Zhinian.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.440
That's a beautiful name.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.240
Ye Wuming, what's wrong with you?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.000
Ye Wuming.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.000
Are you okay?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.960
I'm fine, Father.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.800
You must have caught a chill.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.000

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.320

Help me get things ready.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.440
Tomorrow, we'll take him to the academy.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.480
Are you alright?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.040
I'm fine.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.560

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.960

(Luoshan Academy)

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.160
Alright.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.240
Just leave me here.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.160
Well,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.200
we're at the academy gate now.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.080
I...

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:56.840
I don't know the way.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.120
So, the man who wrote a poem here

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.120
and saved his wife

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.920
wasn't you, was it?

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.280
You just like embarrassing me.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.600
My bad.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.480
Study hard.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.880
I'm leaving.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.200
What?

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.080
You've forgotten one thing.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.240
What are you doing?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.240
We're at the academy.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.000
Now everyone knows

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.080
that you have a wife.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.440
Alright.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.800
Now I can focus on studies.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.480
Go.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.440
I'm leaving.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.720
Take care.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.280
Got it.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.360
Excuse me, are you Ye Wuming?

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.640
Are you alright?

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.360
Come on.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.120
Sorry.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.360
There's no need to bow like this.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.920
You know me?

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.560
I am Su Chun.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.400
I heard your heroic act

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.600
of composing poetry to save your wife

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.160
and mock Liu Chen here.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.960
I wasn't there myself,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.720
but

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.240
just hearing about it

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.480
made my blood boil.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.440
You flatter me.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.880
Not flattery at all.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.640
I heard

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.000
you've also been

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.320
helping villagers write legal petitions.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.400
You can use your knowledge

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.720
to help common folk.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.320
Unlike me.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.520
All these years,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.600
I've only studied and taken exams.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.160
I'm ashamed.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.440
My ambition

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.160
is to uphold conscience of the world

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.240
and stand for the people.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.360
Wuming.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.280
Let's talk inside.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.840
Come.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.560
Here.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.560
Mind the steps.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.000
It's an old disease.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.360
Years ago, when I went

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.920
to the capital for the exams,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.280
I publicly denounced a Prime Minister

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.160
for the unfairness of the exam system.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.360
They threw me out,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.360
shattered my knee

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.640
and stripped me of my title.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560
But it doesn't matter.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.000
I will start over.

00:05:57.856 --> 00:05:59.000
Your integrity is admirable.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.720
Integrity or not,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.160
I just want justice.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.800
If I pass this time,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.880
I'll shake the entire court.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.640
Good!

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.200
If I'm fortunate enough to pass as well,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.640
I'll help you cut away

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.160
all thorns of injustice

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.720
in this court.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.400
Wuming.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.600
This way.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.200
Please.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.320
Mai Tian.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.360
I'm back.

prays to you.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.520
May my husband pass the exams

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.680
and clear the Shen family...

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.360
No.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.320
May my husband

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.920
stay safe and healthy.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.760
Nian.

Crown Prince's matter is settled.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.400
Prime Minister has recommended me
for office.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.840
Once everything is resolved,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.160
I will come find you.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.240
Brother?

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.400
At this point,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.400
how can you still deny it?

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.360
Tie the wish ribbon this way,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.600
so it won't fly off.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.200
And your wish will come true.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.560
Brother.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.520
You're alive.
Why didn't you come find me?

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.520
Why didn't you tell me who you are?

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.416
It's not that I didn't want to.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.680
The situation isn't stable yet.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.960
I don't want to bring you trouble.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.440
I'm not afraid of trouble.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.080
Where have you been all these years?

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.600
Have you been well?

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.800
I'm working
under a certain official now.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.680
Once I enter court service,

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.440
I'll uncover the truth back then.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.080
That's good.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.920
Which official?

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.280
The current Prime Minister.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.160
The Prime Minister?

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.880
Forget it.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.880
Some things

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.600
are better left unknown.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.240
Alright.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.880
I'll listen to you.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.520
Come home with me.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.920
Father will be overjoyed.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.520
We must part ways here.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.920
But we've only just reunited.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.480
The matters in Penglai Village

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.720
are nearly over.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.960
You just need to live well

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.320
with your husband.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.560
Remember.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.880
Never mention

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.920
my affairs to anyone.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.760
Brother.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.920
Are you in trouble?

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.560
Tell me.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.960
We can face it together.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160
Don't overthink it.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.880
Just live well

00:10:49.312 --> 00:10:50.440
take good care of yourself,

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.400
and protect yourself.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.560
Mai Tian.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.800
Ye Wuming.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.880
What are you doing, Ye Wuming?

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.120
What's wrong with you?

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.680
Why do you keep pestering my wife?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.320
Why won't you leave us alone?

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.400
Want me to make a move?

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.080
Ye Wuming.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.400
He's here to say goodbye.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.760
It's just a chance encounter.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.800
Why bother?

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.960
Who is he?

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:29.800
I...

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.960
I truly don't know him.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.040
I don't believe it.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.680
You lost your memory, right?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.760
What if I did?

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.640
You know me?

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.080
Since you've forgotten,

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.680
treat everything as a fresh start.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.320
Protect Mai Tian.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.560
That's none of your concern.

00:11:54.304 --> 00:11:55.120
Get out of here!

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.160
Listen to me.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:56.960
Go!

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.320
Why'd I listen to you?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.200
Let's go.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.960
Hurry!

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.280
Go!

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.160
Godfather.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.800
It's so late.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.160
What brings you here?

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.600
Tomorrow morning,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.120
Crown Prince's funeral procession
will depart from here.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.880
Come make some arrangements

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.400
so nothing goes wrong.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.160
Understood.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.760
I'm listening.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.000
I don't know how to explain this.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.280
There are many things

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.800
I can't tell you right now.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.320
Can't tell me?

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.960
We are husband and wife.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.320
Doesn't it count?

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.600
No.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.240
I really can't.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:53.960
As expected,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.920
you still can't let go

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.720
of that man.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.400
I...

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.440
What you just did

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.320
was stalling, right?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.320
No.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.440
I'm just a tool

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.120
to help clear

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.920
your father's name.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.560
Ye Wuming, what are you saying?

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.320
Don't worry.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.000
I'll do as you say.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.680
Ye Wuming.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.520
(Ye Wuming.)

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.800
(I'm sorry.)

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.040
(About what my brother is involved in,)

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.840
(I really can't tell you.)
