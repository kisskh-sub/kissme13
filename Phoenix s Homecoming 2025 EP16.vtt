00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.719
My lady.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:03.560
We've left the palace. Relax a bit.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:04.680
You can slow down.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.280
Huaiyong vanished
while investigating Chancellor Huo's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.120
illegal gunpowder.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.400
Something went wrong.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.000
He is a great martial artist.

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:13.120
I'm sure he's fine.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.760
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.640
I'm not joking.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.200
Wait.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.439
It's been three days.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:33.439
Lord Xie.

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:37.040
Who is Sheng Yunfei to you?

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:38.680
You'd rather die

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.959
than hint about her real identity.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:43.959
I told you.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.760
No matter who she is,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.239
you're bringing disaster upon yourself

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.000
and digging your own grave.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.959
If it weren't for our old times' sake,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.439
I would have killed you.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.599
Take my advice and tell me the truth

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.759
to spare yourself the suffering.

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.680
The court is watching everything
you're doing now, Chancellor Huo.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.919
Chancellor.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.479
Think twice.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.439
We are both loyal ministers
of the Chen State.

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:39.879
As Chancellor,

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:42.560
I toil day and night,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.800
devoting myself to state affairs.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.879
But you

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.080
keep interfering.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.879
But you can't anymore, can you?

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840
Just tell me the truth.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.759
And I'll make it quick.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.479
Xie Fei.

00:03:02.592 --> 00:03:03.192
Fine.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.800
Stubborn as a mule.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.360
Then

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.000
don't blame me.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.840
Chancellor.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.520
Since Grand Tutor Xie is so stubborn,

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.360
why don't we finish him off

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.000
to avoid further trouble?

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:29.759
Finish him off?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.439
If you don't confess by tonight,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.039
the Xie family line will end with you.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.639
(I never thought I'd die here.)

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.240
(I only wish to see you again)

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.479
(before I die.)

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.199
(It's like when I
taught you calligraphy,)

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.159
(always missing that final stroke.)

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.720
How did you...?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.839
Does it hurt?

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:36.120
It's just that

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:40.600
the hairpin I've been carving

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:43.759
is almost done.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.519
With a red ribbon,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.720
it would be my betrothal gift for you.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.200
Huaiyong.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:00.120
Huaiyong.

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:01.519
Huaiyong.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.319
Huaiyong.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.279
Look at me.

00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:05.519
Look at me.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.240
Didn't you say

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.800
you'd be my pawn?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.160
If you vow to be my pawn,

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:16.560
you must remain my pawn for a lifetime.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:19.160
Don't sleep. Look at me.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.040
In this life,

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.199
I begged Heaven

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.519
so hard to bring you back,

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.399
yet I couldn't marry you.

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:44.920
Find a good man

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.240
and marry him.

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:06.920
Huaiyong.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.560
My lord.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.959
If you returned

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.920
to be the schemer,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.040
I'll be your pawn,

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:26.759
at your command.

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:28.959
(You'll seduce someone?)

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.000
(Yes.)

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:32.040
(Kill someone?)

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.959
(Sure.)

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240
(You'll do things)

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:37.240
(a gentleman wouldn't do?)

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:38.680
(No problem.)

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:40.839
(I will do whatever you ask of me,)

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:43.560
(Your Highness.)

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.279
(I want candied hawthorn, too.)

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:51.839
(If you wish to send those fiends
to the underworld,)

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.639
(I will carve)

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.800
(a bloody path
straight to the underworld for you.)

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:01.000
(If you wish to end them yourself,)

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.680
(I shall sharpen the blade for you.)

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.680
(Once the blade is drawn,)

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.600
(it will)

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.360
(surely draw blood.)

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:12.360
(Will you blame me for being useless?)

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.120
(I haven't helped you take revenge,)

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.160
(and I'm dying.)

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.079
I'm sure it's going to be risky.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.360
Huaiyong.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.079
Take good care.

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:28.000
What did you call me?

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:30.199
Huaiyong.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.800
Huaiyong.

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.199
Huaiyong.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.279
Huaiyong.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:37.319
How could one hairpin be enough?

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.680
How could it be enough?

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:39.839
Huaiyong.

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:44.319
Let's go.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.040
Huaiyong,

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:56.439
pulling this "wounded hero" act

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:58.319
is a bit shameless.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.199
Right?

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:03.360
Look, someone's being shameless.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.720
Look, shameless.

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:05.480
Shut up.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:11.279
The knife missed its mark.

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:12.879
You'll be better

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:15.040
after taking some medicine.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.920
Weren't you in the palace today?

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.560
How did you show up there?

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:22.279
I...

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800
Speaking of that,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.519
it's all thanks to me.

00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:41.480
Lord Xie's troops in the mountains
still haven't heard from him.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.799
I was watching the Chancellor.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.919
He led his shadow guards to Zhuozhou.

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:51.279
Your tips came just in time.

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:53.080
I'll work on it.

00:08:53.242 --> 00:08:53.792
Understood.

00:08:53.792 --> 00:08:55.600
That "Ice" still hasn't shown up.

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:57.879
He's rather slow, isn't he?

00:08:58.519 --> 00:08:59.360
Something happened.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:00.600
We must set out now.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:03.639
Chancellor Huo is such an old fox.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.679
We didn't catch him in the act

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.519
to press charges.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.840
We've basically lost the lead

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.799
on the gunpowder.

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:13.720
Things will be

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.240
even trickier from now on.

00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:18.159
This approach has failed.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.799
Why don't we try

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:25.519
to sow discord between
Chancellor Huo and his daughter?

00:09:26.759 --> 00:09:27.919
Given their current tie,

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:29.399
we should try

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.879
to break their alliance
as the Chancellor and the Empress.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.200
Gossip of the Chen State.

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:39.039
I love this stuff.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.776
I'm listening.

00:09:39.776 --> 00:09:40.360
Hurry.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.759
Chancellor Huo has been

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:46.279
urging Huo Wan to bear a royal heir.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.960
He aims to make the young prince

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:50.320
a puppet emperor.

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:52.000
But over the years,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.840
Huo Wan has remained childless.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.720
So Chancellor Huo intends to...

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:00.840
Prince Mu, Chen Can.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.080
When Chen State was founded,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.919
Prince Mu's father
made great contributions

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:12.639
and was rewarded by the royal family.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.039
Two years ago, his father died,

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.360
and Prince Mu

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.480
inherited his father's title.

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:25.840
(Chen Can is a notorious hooligan)

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.399
(in the capital.)

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:29.879
Every commoner in the capital hates him.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.720
However,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.759
no one dares to say anything.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.799
Alright.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.759
I'll do it.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.759
Thank you.

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:57.320
My lord, Xie Fei survived.

00:10:57.799 --> 00:10:58.759
Though he was stabbed,

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.320
Lady Yunfei
and the Seventeenth Prince of Qi

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360
saved him.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:05.320
Fools.

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:08.759
Why can't you just

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:10.840
kill those few people?

00:11:20.919 --> 00:11:21.480
Leave.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.559
Get lost!

00:11:26.624 --> 00:11:29.600
(Imperial Study)

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.720
Your Majesty.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.720
What brings you here?

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:37.639
With my wedding approaching,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.120
I am quite occupied.

00:11:40.159 --> 00:11:42.000
I wish to bring my fiancée
to my residence

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.000
to discuss things with my mother.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.919
As you wish.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.039
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.480
(I will have her by my side,)

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.799
(as my consort, in time.)

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.039
Does it still hurt?

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.679
It's fine.

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:30.879
I've been

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:32.840
holding my breath all day.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.039
I finally relaxed
when His Majesty allowed me

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.639
to bring you home.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.600
They killed me in my past life

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.799
and hurt my most beloved one
in this life.

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:52.320
I'm the one

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.559
you love the most?

00:12:59.200 --> 00:12:59.879
Huaiyong.

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.840
I will not only seek revenge,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.919
but also fulfill my wish.

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:08.480
We won't be parted again.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.728
In this life, and not the next one,
we must be together.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.279
I forgot to prepare a gift
for your mother.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.919
I've prepared it for you.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.240
You can give it to her directly.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.120
No way.

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:45.279
Men and women have different tastes
in choosing gifts.

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:47.120
Let's go.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.248
(Xie Mansion)

00:13:52.384 --> 00:13:54.272
(Lady Xie)

00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:00.440
Who is this young lady?

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.759
What a pretty girl.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.240
Elegant and graceful.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.600
And nice figure.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.200
Don't stand here.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.519
Let's talk inside.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.480
Let's go.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.360
Okay.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.120
Look at you.

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:14.600
Good girl.
