00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:36.200
There are days like that.

00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:40.246
Days when I dreamed about you,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.248
and on those days,

00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:46.544
I can't help falling
into foolish little fantasies.

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:53.259
Like accidentally sharing a table
with you at a random restaurant,

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:58.348
or bumping into you
alone in an empty, late-night theater.

00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:03.436
Just imagining it makes me happy.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.565
And I imagine,

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:11.653
just once, a miracle like that

00:02:12.862 --> 00:02:16.199
could happen to me too.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.911
-The rule of law in Korea is dead!
-Dead!

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:24.332
-Punish those responsible!
-Punish them!

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:25.375
MINISTRY OF JUSTICEㅇ

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:28.294
Re-arrest Lee Seong-ho immediately!

00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:30.255
Arrest him!

00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:34.175
-Investigate without a shred of doubt!
-Investigate!

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.552
Table tennis player Lee Seong-ho,

00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:38.263
accused of blackmail and assault

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:41.432
against a junior teammate,
was acquitted today.

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:46.020
A petition urging a full retrial
has been posted.

00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:49.107
With news of his hiring
a high-priced lawyer,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.984
some legal experts say

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:53.945
with rising distrust,
that the court favors the privileged,

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:57.782
the outrage and criticism
are unlikely to subside anytime soon.

00:02:57.865 --> 00:02:58.992
Attorney Maeng Se-na,

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:01.411
public backlash
against this ruling is fierce.

00:03:01.494 --> 00:03:02.537
As defense attorney,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.747
what's your view on the trial outcome?

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:08.084
COURT

00:03:10.253 --> 00:03:12.880
The significance lies
in revealing the truth.

00:03:12.964 --> 00:03:15.717
The prosecution's claim of special assault

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.719
was not upheld.

00:03:17.802 --> 00:03:21.305
-Justice in Korea is dead!
-Dead!

00:03:23.516 --> 00:03:25.226
Regardless of guilt or innocence,

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.478
the defendant deeply regrets

00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:30.231
causing public concern.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.610
Additionally, please be advised
that spreading false information

00:03:34.694 --> 00:03:37.113
differing from reality
may result in legal action.

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:38.072
That is all.

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.369
PLAYER LEE SEONG-HO
ACQUITTED OF SPECIAL ASSAULT CHARGES

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:50.877
That's our Attorney Maeng!

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.629
Unstoppable and undefeated.

00:03:53.713 --> 00:03:55.465
Truly amazing!

00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:59.052
She looks so good on screen.

00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:00.887
She's gorgeous!

00:04:02.013 --> 00:04:03.765
Don't get too excited.

00:04:03.848 --> 00:04:05.975
People outside are going wild,

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:07.810
saying the poor victim

00:04:07.894 --> 00:04:09.479
should file an appeal.

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:11.731
This is bad.

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:14.317
Public opinion is emotion,
but the law is logic.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.445
Isn't it so? We speak through results.

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:20.365
If it came out not guilty,
that's the correct answer.

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:23.993
-All right.
-I'm Prosecutor Kim Gi-wook…

00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:26.746
The prosecutor looks miserable.

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:28.414
He's going to get chewed out.

00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:29.832
PROSECUTION BRIEFING

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.542
Not the only one she crushed.

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:33.378
Why did this kind of article come out?

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.671
Are you even prosecutors?

00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:39.425
They even held an emergency meeting
at the Seoul Central District Office.

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.803
By the way, how did she win that case?

00:04:42.428 --> 00:04:44.764
There was CCTV footage
and witness testimony.

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.308
That's why she made partner at that age.

00:04:47.392 --> 00:04:49.352
ATTORNEY MAENG SE-NA
CONGRATULATIONS ON BECOMING PARTNER

00:04:49.435 --> 00:04:52.855
That's a talent too.
By taking the most brutal cases,

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.942
she raised her name and her value.

00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:57.527
I wonder how much she's made.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.196
-I'm jealous.
-Feeling jealous?

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:02.824
She takes all the hate the world throws.

00:05:02.907 --> 00:05:05.368
Sometimes she doesn't even seem human.

00:05:05.451 --> 00:05:07.870
More like an AI, an android.

00:05:07.954 --> 00:05:09.205
No emotions,

00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:14.127
no dating, no family, no friends.
She just works all the time.

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.673
Unless she's a robot,
no human could live like that.

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:21.592
That's a very interesting theory.

00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:27.306
Earlier today, the case prosecutor said…

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:29.684
Attorney Maeng!

00:05:30.226 --> 00:05:31.269
When did you get here?

00:05:32.895 --> 00:05:35.565
Twenty-nine minutes ago.

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:38.526
Check for missing copies, please.

00:05:39.777 --> 00:05:41.320
Hey.

00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:45.241
You should've said something
when you arrived.

00:05:45.324 --> 00:05:47.702
Everyone's been waiting
to congratulate you.

00:05:49.036 --> 00:05:51.914
Thank you,
but I am a bit busy today.

00:05:51.998 --> 00:05:56.502
Please forward the brief
from the previous embezzlement case.

00:05:56.586 --> 00:05:57.920
Wait, hold on.

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:02.592
The boss set this up to congratulate you.

00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:06.387
Can't you read the room?

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.805
That's fine.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.558
I just thanked him a moment ago.

00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:12.602
-Yes, I heard her.
-But…

00:06:13.561 --> 00:06:16.981
You're not planning to lecture me
for skipping a gathering

00:06:17.064 --> 00:06:20.276
I wasn't even informed about, are you?

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:23.279
-I'm just--
-I'm sorry,

00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:26.282
but I can't rearrange my schedule.

00:06:26.365 --> 00:06:27.992
And I'd rather not waste anyone's time

00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:31.120
-by celebrating my personal achievements.
-Right.

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:38.085
This is why I like her.

00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:41.923
But it's a happy day,
so just take a moment to cool off--

00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:44.008
I'm sorry, but I must decline.

00:06:45.426 --> 00:06:46.761
-My shift is over.
-Huh?

00:06:47.637 --> 00:06:48.971
Already?

00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:51.307
Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

00:06:53.017 --> 00:06:56.229
At least grab a bite.
You always skip your meals.

00:06:56.312 --> 00:07:00.399
Is that really enough?
Should I pack this for you, then?

00:07:00.483 --> 00:07:02.068
What a brat.

00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:06.447
Why won't you eat it? It's expensive.

00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:21.254
From listener 3751,

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:24.215
Do Ra-ik's "It's Me"

00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:26.092
has finally dropped.

00:07:26.175 --> 00:07:29.929
I'd love to share
this exciting first moment.

00:07:30.012 --> 00:07:31.264
Today's new release.

00:07:31.347 --> 00:07:35.268
Do Ra-ik of Gold Boys
has returned with a solo comeback.

00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:38.062
With our final song, "It's Me,"

00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:40.606
I hope you all have a wonderful evening.

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:59.458
I walk a path that's neither
Warm nor cold

00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:02.086
After walking alone for so long

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:07.341
I start to mistake the creeping unease

00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:09.760
Sometimes it feels like
It'll never end

00:08:09.844 --> 00:08:13.889
And even the broken moments of rest
Were never truly mine

00:08:13.973 --> 00:08:17.602
But anyone would feel the same

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:22.732
I can't live mindlessly

00:08:22.815 --> 00:08:28.195
The way the world wants me to

00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:35.494
I'm still me, just as I've always been

00:08:35.578 --> 00:08:36.662
Not once…

00:08:36.746 --> 00:08:39.248
You have a message from Like.

00:08:39.915 --> 00:08:42.001
I'm streaming, no DMs.

00:08:42.084 --> 00:08:43.252
SMING: Repeatedly streaming a song
to boost its chart ranking

00:08:43.336 --> 00:08:46.255
I'm still the same as you know me

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:48.799
There is nothing less

00:08:48.883 --> 00:08:51.552
There is nothing more

00:08:55.139 --> 00:08:56.432
Nice.

00:08:56.515 --> 00:08:59.852
It's me

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.026
Let's get started.

00:09:08.861 --> 00:09:10.029
Our cutie.

00:09:10.738 --> 00:09:12.156
We'll spoil you.

00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:13.366
DO RA-IK

00:09:13.449 --> 00:09:15.409
ADD TO PLAYLIST

00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:22.541
FANJJAEK

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:24.085
RA-IK SOLO

00:09:25.044 --> 00:09:26.087
RA-IK SOLO COMEBACK

00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:34.261
CONGRATS ON RA-IK'S SOLO

00:09:34.345 --> 00:09:35.429
RA-IK SOLO COMEBACK

00:09:36.347 --> 00:09:37.390
YOU ARE THE BEST, RA-IK!

00:09:45.064 --> 00:09:48.859
DO RA-IK

00:10:00.329 --> 00:10:02.331
DO RA-IK'S "IT'S ME" VIDEO PHOTOSHOOT

00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:04.458
What is this?

00:10:05.584 --> 00:10:06.669
He looks like a statue.

00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:13.426
Please notify me

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.303
of Do Ra-ik's photoshoots

00:10:16.387 --> 00:10:18.764
like an emergency alert.

00:10:23.394 --> 00:10:27.398
Do Ra-ik, "It's me" is a total hit.

00:10:28.524 --> 00:10:30.192
I heard you won the case.

00:10:30.276 --> 00:10:31.944
-We should celebrate.
-I'm busy.

00:10:35.698 --> 00:10:36.866
I brought this too.

00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:42.621
Just leave it there.

00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:46.333
What about me? Am I supposed to starve?

00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:48.043
I brought it all the way here.

00:11:06.437 --> 00:11:07.980
Did you eat before all that?

00:11:08.063 --> 00:11:10.107
Food isn't the priority.

00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:12.526
It's the historic day
Ra-ik dropped his solo.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.028
Did you hit the like button?

00:11:14.111 --> 00:11:15.946
We must support him however we can.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.198
Please.

00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:19.575
Mind your own business first.

00:11:19.658 --> 00:11:22.661
The whole internet is blowing up
over the Lee Seong-ho case,

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:25.789
saying things like "They freed a devil"
and "She just wants money."

00:11:25.873 --> 00:11:27.625
It's nothing new. I won, that's all.

00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:30.586
You should've just made
one statement at the photo line.

00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:33.756
The assault was nothing
but the victim's word,

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:36.675
and that so-called CCTV evidence
was just a light shove.

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:39.803
I gathered all the evidence
to counter it for you.

00:11:39.887 --> 00:11:41.889
I already said everything in court.

00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:45.643
Which is why people keep saying
you only care about money.

00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:50.481
Truth is, every other lawyer
was too scared to take the case,

00:11:50.564 --> 00:11:51.524
but you took it on.

00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:55.319
People only see and believe
what they want.

00:11:55.402 --> 00:11:58.364
No matter what I say,
they won't believe me.

00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:01.909
I just do my job.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.828
Because in the end,

00:12:04.912 --> 00:12:07.748
the truth always comes out in court.

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:11.585
And people aren't

00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:13.837
entirely wrong.

00:12:13.921 --> 00:12:15.130
Money is part of it.

00:12:15.756 --> 00:12:17.633
When I take tough cases, I earn more.

00:12:17.716 --> 00:12:21.720
And the more I earn,
the more I can support Ra-ik.

00:12:21.804 --> 00:12:25.140
You get all that hate, work so hard,
and spend it all on him.

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:27.184
You don't think it's a waste?

00:12:27.268 --> 00:12:29.603
Waste? I feel bad I can't give him more.

00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:36.402
What's so great about him anyway?

00:12:36.485 --> 00:12:39.071
He looks pretty much the same as I do.

00:12:39.154 --> 00:12:40.739
Chung-jae!

00:12:40.823 --> 00:12:42.449
What you are saying is…

00:12:45.411 --> 00:12:46.954
You're basically saying

00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:52.084
a mud lump squeezed by a toddler
and thrown around

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:53.752
is the same

00:12:53.836 --> 00:12:55.296
as Michelangelo's David

00:12:55.379 --> 00:12:58.299
in an Italian museum.

00:12:59.174 --> 00:13:01.302
Where's the mirror? Go look at yourself.

00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:04.054
Or get your eyes checked.
You must be sick.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.183
He just looks fancy on the outside.

00:13:08.267 --> 00:13:09.977
He's just a person like us.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.521
He poops, farts,

00:13:12.605 --> 00:13:14.607
and gets chili flakes stuck
in his teeth.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.817
No, Ra-ik is different.

00:13:18.736 --> 00:13:20.237
These are all the same person.

00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:21.822
Why are you hoarding this stuff?

00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:25.284
Don't touch it with greasy hands.

00:13:30.623 --> 00:13:31.790
Chung-jae,

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:35.127
you really don't know what love is.

00:13:36.253 --> 00:13:38.631
I know it better than you,
a lifelong single.

00:13:41.258 --> 00:13:43.927
You don't know anything.

00:13:44.762 --> 00:13:46.263
Love is something

00:13:46.347 --> 00:13:49.350
that destroys any sense of logic.

00:13:49.433 --> 00:13:52.102
Sure, I've told myself,
"I should stop buying these,"

00:13:52.186 --> 00:13:54.188
and "Why am I buying another one?"

00:13:55.147 --> 00:13:56.023
How could I not?

00:13:57.232 --> 00:13:58.108
It's this pretty!

00:14:00.027 --> 00:14:01.820
You just go for it first.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:07.868
Love doesn't need a reason, it never has.

00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:14.792
Even knowing well
that no answer will come back.

00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:18.212
Just shouting his name out loud

00:14:18.295 --> 00:14:20.422
is enough to fill your whole heart.

00:14:21.173 --> 00:14:24.927
Like a flawless diamond
admired simply for existing,

00:14:26.303 --> 00:14:28.847
just its presence alone

00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:31.058
makes every explanation unnecessary.

00:14:32.643 --> 00:14:36.563
To give all of yourself
without a hint of regret…

00:14:38.732 --> 00:14:40.567
that is what true love is.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.569
Oppa!

00:14:45.823 --> 00:14:46.824
Ra-ik!

00:15:14.018 --> 00:15:15.936
How did this happen again?

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.230
I told you to tighten security.

00:15:18.313 --> 00:15:20.566
I switched to the best security company,

00:15:20.649 --> 00:15:22.109
but your fans are so…

00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:31.785
Let's go.

00:15:32.369 --> 00:15:34.455
You haven't told him about it yet, right?

00:15:36.874 --> 00:15:38.125
It's fine.

00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:40.502
He'll understand if I tell him.

00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:44.173
Just tell him now.

00:15:47.885 --> 00:15:50.095
How am I going on stage
with hair like this?

00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:51.346
Why am I the only one trying?

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.724
Why am I always the only one who cares?

00:15:55.976 --> 00:15:57.352
Let me check my outfit.

00:16:03.233 --> 00:16:04.193
I'm going to the car.

00:16:04.276 --> 00:16:05.360
Ra-ik!

00:16:05.444 --> 00:16:09.156
Why the car? It's your solo debut.
You have to go on stage.

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:10.699
Then prepare things properly.

00:16:10.783 --> 00:16:13.494
Hair, makeup, and outfit,
none of them is right.

00:16:13.577 --> 00:16:15.496
How am I supposed to perform like this?

00:16:15.579 --> 00:16:16.747
We can redo everything.

00:16:17.372 --> 00:16:19.166
-Come on, let's--
-No, I don't need it.

00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:22.211
Move.

00:16:22.294 --> 00:16:24.463
-I said move.
-Wait, hold on.

00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:27.966
Let's talk for a second.

00:16:29.343 --> 00:16:32.429
Excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.

00:16:33.388 --> 00:16:35.808
Let's step out for a moment.

00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:47.194
Move out, seriously!

00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:56.912
I'm sorry, it's really my fault.

00:16:56.995 --> 00:16:58.122
Why didn' t you tell me?

00:16:58.205 --> 00:17:00.624
-I knew you wouldn't come.
-I shouldn't have.

00:17:00.707 --> 00:17:02.835
I said from the start
that I don't do music shows.

00:17:02.918 --> 00:17:05.212
Given my seniority,
after all I conceded,

00:17:05.295 --> 00:17:08.048
shouldn't the company support me too?

00:17:08.132 --> 00:17:10.008
How could you give the ending

00:17:10.092 --> 00:17:12.344
to those TMB or whatever they are?

00:17:12.427 --> 00:17:15.097
You should've said, "If you're not giving
the ending, back off.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.974
He's got plenty of stages waiting."

00:17:18.392 --> 00:17:21.186
If you can't handle that,
why make me come here?

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.064
I couldn't help it.
TMB is huge these days.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.030
They're huge?
I've never even heard of them.

00:17:32.114 --> 00:17:34.575
They're not huge, just rookies.

00:17:34.658 --> 00:17:36.827
It's your first solo,

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.913
so of course your solo power
can't match the group's…

00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:43.000
But compared to your fandom,

00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:45.002
they're tiny.

00:17:47.379 --> 00:17:49.423
Honestly, if you were Ra-ik of Gold Boys,

00:17:49.506 --> 00:17:51.967
that would be different.
But this is your first solo.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.469
That's why we got you on music shows.

00:17:54.553 --> 00:17:56.847
But with new rookies blowing up,
no one can stop that.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.725
Not me, not the CEO, not the company.

00:17:59.808 --> 00:18:00.726
Only you can.

00:18:06.106 --> 00:18:07.900
They said to stand by.

00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:10.235
You're still pretty good.

00:18:11.278 --> 00:18:12.905
I'm fully fired up now.

00:18:13.906 --> 00:18:16.825
What are you doing?
Bring the staff in, we don't have time.

00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:18.952
Yes.

00:18:21.413 --> 00:18:23.832
Come in! Hurry!

00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:27.336
My flame, who's tall, handsome,

00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:29.379
and an amazing actor,

00:18:29.463 --> 00:18:31.715
was actually the main vocalist
of a 12-year band.

00:18:31.798 --> 00:18:35.427
The versatile Ra-ik from Gold Boys
excels at both bass and vocals,

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.639
has now returned as a solo artist.

00:18:38.722 --> 00:18:40.933
He says it shows his true self, sincerely.

00:18:41.016 --> 00:18:42.893
Mr. Do Ra-ik, please stand by.

00:18:42.976 --> 00:18:45.103
Let's hear it now, "It's Me."

00:18:46.271 --> 00:18:49.399
I walk a path
That's neither warm nor cold

00:18:49.483 --> 00:18:51.818
After walking alone for so long

00:18:51.902 --> 00:18:57.115
I start to mistake the creeping unease

00:18:57.199 --> 00:18:59.868
Sometimes it feels like
It'll never end

00:18:59.952 --> 00:19:03.497
And even the broken moments of rest
Were never truly mine

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:07.084
But anyone would feel the same…

00:19:07.167 --> 00:19:09.836
One day, I swear I'll kill that bastard.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.089
No, I'll kill him.

00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:15.509
They have no idea, huh?

00:19:15.592 --> 00:19:18.637
That lunatic is actually a total psycho.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.305
If they knew, they wouldn't be here.

00:19:20.389 --> 00:19:25.269
I'm still me, just as I've always been

00:19:25.352 --> 00:19:30.482
Not once have I ever been
Anyone but myself

00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:32.818
I'm still

00:19:32.901 --> 00:19:36.154
The same as you know me

00:19:36.238 --> 00:19:38.490
There is nothing less

00:19:38.573 --> 00:19:41.034
There is nothing more

00:19:41.118 --> 00:19:44.121
The purpose of this amendment

00:19:44.204 --> 00:19:47.541
is to recalculate
the defendants' breach of trust

00:19:47.624 --> 00:19:51.545
based on the valuation report.

00:19:52.212 --> 00:19:54.423
There is a gap between the actual value

00:19:54.506 --> 00:19:57.926
and the purchase price,
so I'll explain them one by one.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:02.014
The actual value of the Areum real estate
purchased by the defendants…

00:20:03.724 --> 00:20:04.891
Let me see.

00:20:05.642 --> 00:20:08.729
…has been revised upward
from 50 million won.

00:20:08.812 --> 00:20:10.105
to 1.46 billion won.

00:20:10.647 --> 00:20:13.650
Accordingly, the difference in price

00:20:13.734 --> 00:20:18.071
has also been revised,
from 640 million won to 430 million won.

00:20:20.532 --> 00:20:21.658
Your Honor, I'm sorry,

00:20:21.742 --> 00:20:23.535
but could you please instruct
defense counsel

00:20:23.618 --> 00:20:27.039
to refrain from actions
that impede the proceedings?

00:20:28.373 --> 00:20:30.959
The one obstructing this trial
is the prosecution.

00:20:31.043 --> 00:20:32.252
I, as defense counsel,

00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:35.172
have an unavoidable reason,
chronic respiratory condition.

00:20:35.797 --> 00:20:38.633
But the prosecutor
is deliberately delaying the trial

00:20:38.717 --> 00:20:41.428
by abusing
the indictment amendment system.

00:20:41.511 --> 00:20:44.264
It's just to make the allegations clearer…

00:20:44.348 --> 00:20:46.099
So, is it clearer now?

00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:48.143
From what I see here,

00:20:48.226 --> 00:20:51.480
the date, location,
and method of the offense

00:20:51.563 --> 00:20:52.981
have not been supplemented.

00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:55.776
You were told to file before the hearing,

00:20:55.859 --> 00:20:58.320
yet you filed on the day of the hearing,

00:20:58.403 --> 00:21:00.572
-without proper preparation…
-Your Honor,

00:21:01.239 --> 00:21:03.492
under Article 27, Paragraph 3
of the Criminal Act,

00:21:03.575 --> 00:21:06.411
it is stated that every citizen
has the right to a prompt trial.

00:21:06.495 --> 00:21:09.831
For the sake of the defendant,
who is suffering from a prolonged trial,

00:21:09.915 --> 00:21:13.210
I earnestly request that the court

00:21:13.293 --> 00:21:16.505
proceed without further delay.

00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:26.932
South entrance of the West Building.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.398
I'm fine.

00:21:50.914 --> 00:21:52.457
Prosecutor Kwak!

00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:54.167
-What are you doing here?
-Here.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.962
-I came for the trial, and--
-And?

00:21:57.045 --> 00:22:00.132
Something came up, so I need to spare time
for the woman who went inside.

00:22:00.215 --> 00:22:01.508
A woman? You?

00:22:02.717 --> 00:22:03.718
Is she pretty?

00:22:03.802 --> 00:22:05.011
No, not like that.

00:22:05.554 --> 00:22:07.431
Some woman did this to my coffee

00:22:07.514 --> 00:22:10.684
and then walked in there,
and my shoes are a mess.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.147
-Really?
-She needs to learn

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.107
that a simple apology
doesn't cover the damage.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.316
Right?

00:22:20.777 --> 00:22:22.696
Some people only learn basic manners

00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:24.948
when you teach them.

00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:27.325
Because they grew up
without learning basic manners.

00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:28.910
Right.

00:22:28.994 --> 00:22:31.538
Could you tell the person inside
to come out quickly?

00:22:31.621 --> 00:22:33.415
I'm in a hurry.

00:22:33.498 --> 00:22:34.875
There's no one inside.

00:22:56.146 --> 00:22:57.939
I said not to call me
for things like this.

00:22:58.023 --> 00:22:59.274
Am I a taxi?

00:22:59.357 --> 00:23:01.151
If I drive now, it's going to be jammed.

00:23:01.234 --> 00:23:02.611
Then take the subway.

00:23:03.528 --> 00:23:05.113
Double the premium taxi surcharge.

00:23:26.426 --> 00:23:29.012
What if you get vocal nodules again?

00:23:29.095 --> 00:23:31.223
I told you not to strain yourself.

00:23:31.306 --> 00:23:34.142
Just hold on until the autograph session.

00:23:35.018 --> 00:23:37.103
If fans find out, they'll freak out.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.695
Ra-ik!

00:23:46.696 --> 00:23:47.906
I know it's you.

00:23:48.657 --> 00:23:50.700
Why aren't you talking, huh?

00:23:58.792 --> 00:24:01.336
This is Do Ra-ik's number, right?
I love you, Do Ra-ik.

00:24:01.419 --> 00:24:03.380
How can you treat a fan like this?
My love, Do Ra-ik.

00:24:03.463 --> 00:24:04.798
You're so mean, Ra-ik, reply to me.

00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:07.425
I'm watching everything.
You're reading my messages, right?

00:24:07.509 --> 00:24:09.552
I know it all.
You changed your home password.

00:24:09.636 --> 00:24:11.638
Tell me too.
Why am I the only one left out?

00:24:25.443 --> 00:24:26.778
TO. YOO-JIN

00:24:28.697 --> 00:24:29.864
Here it is.

00:24:29.948 --> 00:24:31.866
-Thank you.
-Get home safe.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.368
Ra-ik, you're so handsome!

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.999
-What's your name?
-I'm Hye-joo.

00:24:43.586 --> 00:24:46.298
-Your name is Hye-joo?
-Yes, it's Sim Hye-joo.

00:24:48.675 --> 00:24:50.135
That's a pretty name.

00:24:52.429 --> 00:24:54.723
Ra-ik, you're really handsome.

00:24:54.806 --> 00:24:57.767
Thank you, Hye-joo, thanks for coming.

00:24:58.977 --> 00:25:00.437
Thank you.

00:25:08.695 --> 00:25:09.738
Ra-ik.

00:25:10.322 --> 00:25:11.406
Hey, Ra-ik!

00:25:17.037 --> 00:25:18.330
What's your name?

00:25:18.413 --> 00:25:20.415
You still don't remember my name?

00:25:20.498 --> 00:25:22.542
It's been years.

00:25:23.168 --> 00:25:25.962
What's your IQ?

00:25:26.046 --> 00:25:27.130
Sorry.

00:25:27.213 --> 00:25:30.175
-Tell me again, and I'll remember it.
-Yeah?

00:25:30.258 --> 00:25:32.010
I can't just tell you.

00:25:32.093 --> 00:25:34.596
If you tell me what I want to know,
I'll tell you.

00:25:37.557 --> 00:25:40.143
What do you want to know?

00:25:40.226 --> 00:25:41.061
Your phone number.

00:25:42.604 --> 00:25:44.147
Why do you keep changing it?

00:25:45.023 --> 00:25:47.692
Give me your number, didn't you hear me?

00:25:47.776 --> 00:25:51.988
Give me your phone number!

00:25:52.072 --> 00:25:54.908
Hey, give me your number!

00:25:54.991 --> 00:25:56.284
Hey!

00:25:56.368 --> 00:25:57.535
Ra-ik, you!

00:25:57.619 --> 00:26:00.413
Do you know how much money I spent on you?

00:26:00.497 --> 00:26:02.499
Ra-ik, I'm sorry!

00:26:02.582 --> 00:26:04.084
I was wrong!

00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:07.504
I love you!

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.174
Ra-ik!

00:26:12.217 --> 00:26:15.178
Do Ra-ik, I love you.

00:26:42.872 --> 00:26:44.290
Ra-ik, what's going on?

00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:48.628
Open the door.

00:26:49.879 --> 00:26:51.172
I'm fine, just go.

00:26:53.174 --> 00:26:55.260
Okay, I'll wait outside.
Come out when you're ready.

00:27:16.906 --> 00:27:19.367
Hey, drop me off up there.

00:27:19.451 --> 00:27:20.785
By this pillar?

00:27:23.913 --> 00:27:25.832
Thanks, I'll go in first.

00:27:29.919 --> 00:27:31.045
Excuse me.

00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:35.884
Thank you.

00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:43.725
So clumsy.

00:27:50.148 --> 00:27:52.358
Ra-ik was really cool today, right?

00:27:52.442 --> 00:27:53.776
He's even better in person.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.237
The camera can't capture it all.

00:28:07.624 --> 00:28:12.253
DO RA-IK, I LOVE YOU

00:28:28.645 --> 00:28:30.313
I missed the autograph session,

00:28:31.064 --> 00:28:32.273
and the music show too.

00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:36.152
If I end up missing the solo concert too…

00:28:38.154 --> 00:28:40.782
Don't cry looking like that.
It's embarrassing.

00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:43.117
Why do you show up looking like that?

00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:44.786
You're here to see your flame.

00:28:47.747 --> 00:28:49.541
People must not recognize me.

00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:53.461
I get every insult
for defending all kinds of scumbags.

00:28:53.545 --> 00:28:54.963
What if someone recognizes me?

00:28:55.046 --> 00:28:57.048
If they find out
someone like me is his fan,

00:28:57.131 --> 00:28:59.092
he could get criticized too.

00:28:59.175 --> 00:29:01.010
And if he knew, he might be disappointed.

00:29:01.094 --> 00:29:02.720
That guy wouldn't recognize you

00:29:02.804 --> 00:29:06.140
even if you showed up
in a bright red evening dress.

00:29:06.224 --> 00:29:07.475
You look really ordinary.

00:29:12.605 --> 00:29:13.982
It's fine.

00:29:14.858 --> 00:29:15.859
I'm fine

00:29:17.318 --> 00:29:18.444
just watching…

00:29:20.697 --> 00:29:21.781
from afar…

00:29:23.116 --> 00:29:24.868
just being able to look at him is enough.

00:29:26.995 --> 00:29:28.663
That's really enough.

00:30:11.331 --> 00:30:14.083
I woke up at four, stopped by the salon,

00:30:15.043 --> 00:30:17.003
went to the music show for the recording,

00:30:17.086 --> 00:30:19.839
then went to the evening autograph
session, and I only just got back.

00:30:22.926 --> 00:30:25.470
I didn't know
there was still a fan meeting left.

00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:30.767
Come out.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.271
If you're not out here in three seconds,
I'll really get mad.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.482
One,

00:30:38.733 --> 00:30:39.984
two,

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:41.527
three!

00:30:45.698 --> 00:30:48.534
Why aren't you sleeping today…

00:30:50.912 --> 00:30:53.164
But why do you drink so much?

00:30:53.247 --> 00:30:54.707
Don't you care about your health?

00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:57.043
Yeah, you've started promotions now.

00:30:57.126 --> 00:31:00.046
You need to manage yourself
or you'll look swollen again.

00:31:04.342 --> 00:31:06.719
This is something like a diffuser.

00:31:11.391 --> 00:31:15.478
-Move out!
-We really had an appointment to meet.

00:31:17.772 --> 00:31:18.690
For real!

00:31:18.773 --> 00:31:21.526
-We have not been informed of anything.
-No, really.

00:31:21.609 --> 00:31:25.363
Ra-ik promised to make us Kimchi Udon.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:54.559
Why? Why not put soap
while you're at it?

00:31:55.518 --> 00:31:56.894
Give me a towel.

00:32:05.653 --> 00:32:06.612
Hey.

00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:11.325
You call yourselves fans when you barge
into someone's home?

00:32:11.951 --> 00:32:14.704
You're the same as cockroaches.

00:32:15.288 --> 00:32:17.206
Dirty, disgusting, and repulsive!

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:18.958
The company could've handled this,

00:32:19.042 --> 00:32:21.252
but you couldn't hold it in
and created this mess?

00:32:21.335 --> 00:32:23.588
Do you know how much money
we spent to contain it?

00:32:23.671 --> 00:32:25.631
Here, the towel.

00:32:25.715 --> 00:32:27.717
What's wrong with calling a criminal
a criminal?

00:32:28.551 --> 00:32:30.136
Don't I earn this much for you?

00:32:31.888 --> 00:32:34.932
You really think
you're worth that much, don't you?

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:37.518
I can tell by all you're wearing.

00:32:38.352 --> 00:32:41.022
I've never seen that ring,
did you get it new?

00:32:41.105 --> 00:32:44.192
Gold keeps going up in value
if you hold onto it.

00:32:44.275 --> 00:32:46.527
You on the other hand keep going down.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.407
You haven't checked yet?

00:32:52.158 --> 00:32:53.951
You dropped to tenth yesterday.

00:32:54.035 --> 00:32:54.994
What?

00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:03.211
You know how important
this solo promotion is, right?

00:33:03.294 --> 00:33:06.255
Thanks to you cursing out fans,

00:33:07.423 --> 00:33:10.426
we nearly lost every ad deal,
you know that?

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.762
They weren't fans, they were stalkers.

00:33:12.845 --> 00:33:15.264
They snuck into my home. I'm the victim.

00:33:15.348 --> 00:33:19.560
I know, you must've been shocked too.

00:33:19.644 --> 00:33:21.687
They go in and out of your house
more than you,

00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:23.940
and even steal your underwear.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.694
Yeah, it must be driving you crazy.
I get it.

00:33:28.778 --> 00:33:32.615
But the moment you show all your emotions,

00:33:32.698 --> 00:33:36.911
you're no longer Do Ra-ik of Gold Boys,
you're just the human Do Ra-ik.

00:33:36.994 --> 00:33:39.622
People don't want the human Do Ra-ik!

00:33:39.705 --> 00:33:44.043
You can only deserve all of this
if you keep that perfect image.

00:33:44.127 --> 00:33:47.755
No swearing, no drinking, understand?

00:33:51.092 --> 00:33:52.468
If you understand,

00:33:52.552 --> 00:33:55.221
then wash up and go practice.
The concert is soon.

00:33:58.224 --> 00:34:00.518
-Take him straight to the practice room.
-Yes, sir.

00:34:01.894 --> 00:34:03.271
Then…

00:34:05.106 --> 00:34:07.733
when can I finally live freely?

00:34:09.902 --> 00:34:13.447
Since I met you when I was ten,
I've only done exactly what I was told.

00:34:14.115 --> 00:34:17.827
When will I be able to say
I'm hurting when I'm hurt,

00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:21.914
and tell people who wronged me
to stop tormenting me?

00:34:21.998 --> 00:34:25.209
When can I live as the human Do Ra-ik?

00:34:29.213 --> 00:34:30.381
Well.

00:34:31.507 --> 00:34:32.884
If you keep this up,

00:34:33.551 --> 00:34:36.345
that day might come sooner.

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:38.848
The day when nobody loves you anymore.

00:35:15.218 --> 00:35:16.052
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

00:35:24.977 --> 00:35:26.020
HIGH TRAFFIC DETECTED

00:35:27.313 --> 00:35:28.356
It's coming!

00:35:28.439 --> 00:35:29.523
It's opening!

00:35:30.107 --> 00:35:32.777
It opened!

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.488
Stay calm.

00:35:36.072 --> 00:35:36.948
I can do this.

00:35:38.282 --> 00:35:39.283
Then what about here?

00:35:39.367 --> 00:35:41.285
THE SEAT IS ALREADY BOOKED.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.247
THE SEAT IS ALREADY BOOKED.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.503
-What? What's wrong with her?
-Don't look at her.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.381
SEAT ALREADY BOOKED.

00:35:58.094 --> 00:35:59.178
No way.

00:35:59.762 --> 00:36:02.890
This photocard has never failed me.

00:36:02.974 --> 00:36:04.809
It's my lucky charm.

00:36:17.113 --> 00:36:18.322
DO RA-IK SOLO CONCERT

00:36:18.406 --> 00:36:19.365
CONCERT TICKET TRANSFER

00:36:19.448 --> 00:36:21.242
Solo concert ticket transfer.

00:36:21.325 --> 00:36:22.702
300,000 won with the ticket.

00:36:22.785 --> 00:36:26.664
Why are they auctioning off
Ra-ik's concert tickets?

00:36:28.708 --> 00:36:31.836
Why do I have to miss the concert
because of scalpers?

00:36:31.919 --> 00:36:33.921
Starting today,
I'm reporting scalpers.

00:36:34.005 --> 00:36:36.132
Because of scalpers, macros,
and Goldie's ignorance,

00:36:36.215 --> 00:36:38.968
I'm clenching my teeth through life.

00:36:42.054 --> 00:36:42.972
TICKET SCALPERS

00:36:43.931 --> 00:36:47.476
Is the transfer still available?

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.731
Yes, please make an offer.

00:36:53.774 --> 00:36:55.192
500,000 Won.

00:36:56.485 --> 00:36:58.654
I've been offered 550,000 Won.

00:36:59.322 --> 00:37:00.906
I'll pay 500,000 won upfront

00:37:02.408 --> 00:37:05.077
and another 500,000 won
on the day of the concert.

00:37:08.581 --> 00:37:09.665
Deal.

00:38:37.795 --> 00:38:38.671
SOLO FAIL?

00:38:38.754 --> 00:38:40.798
To shine the brightest at the top,

00:38:40.881 --> 00:38:43.551
you must completely hide your own shadow.

00:38:44.552 --> 00:38:46.470
You have to smile, speak, and act

00:38:46.554 --> 00:38:48.764
exactly the way they want,

00:38:49.807 --> 00:38:53.060
fitting yourself to their desires.

00:38:53.644 --> 00:38:56.605
That's the only way to be loved.

00:38:58.149 --> 00:39:00.651
And that's how you slowly wither.

00:39:01.986 --> 00:39:04.989
Erasing yourself completely.

00:39:06.657 --> 00:39:09.952
The symptoms likely began because of that.

00:39:10.911 --> 00:39:12.455
The fear that you're fading,

00:39:13.038 --> 00:39:15.458
disappearing entirely,

00:39:15.541 --> 00:39:18.252
turned into panic attacks.

00:39:18.878 --> 00:39:21.714
The tinnitus is also part of the symptoms.

00:39:23.382 --> 00:39:26.260
We need to begin treatment
before it worsens--

00:39:26.343 --> 00:39:27.219
Doctor,

00:39:28.387 --> 00:39:30.389
I already disappeared a long time ago.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.811
Just give me the meds, I'm busy.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:37.771
We will be ready soon.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.025
Ra-ik, where are you!

00:39:41.108 --> 00:39:43.611
Every staff member is here.
It's the day of your concert!

00:39:44.111 --> 00:39:45.154
I'm almost there!

00:39:45.779 --> 00:39:46.697
Stop rushing me.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.074
Where on earth did you go?

00:39:49.158 --> 00:39:52.328
I'm entering the parking lot.
Have Sang-beom come out.

00:39:53.537 --> 00:39:55.581
-What did he say?
-Go to the parking lot now, hurry.

00:39:56.207 --> 00:39:57.500
Yes.

00:40:45.798 --> 00:40:47.383
Excuse me.

00:40:49.343 --> 00:40:50.386
It's you.

00:40:59.562 --> 00:41:01.438
Hey, money first.

00:41:12.408 --> 00:41:15.286
-What is this?
-What do you think?

00:41:15.369 --> 00:41:18.163
You've been caught
committing illegal ticket scalping

00:41:18.247 --> 00:41:21.000
that harms the concert ecosystem
and consumer rights.

00:41:21.083 --> 00:41:23.127
So you will now be escorted
to the police station

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.588
to face the full extent of the law.

00:41:28.507 --> 00:41:29.800
Hey!

00:41:30.342 --> 00:41:32.928
Under Article 3, Paragraph 2, Clause 4
of the Misdemeanor Punishment Act

00:41:33.012 --> 00:41:35.431
selling tickets at a premium
is punishable by a fine

00:41:35.514 --> 00:41:37.891
of up to 200,000 Won,
detention, or a minor fine.

00:41:53.324 --> 00:41:54.908
Hey, isn't that Ra-ik's manager?

00:41:54.992 --> 00:41:57.036
Where have you been?

00:41:57.119 --> 00:41:58.120
Everyone is…

00:41:59.496 --> 00:42:00.539
It's Ra-ik!

00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:08.631
There's a staff passage over there.

00:42:08.714 --> 00:42:11.091
-Go first, hurry!
-Where?

00:42:14.219 --> 00:42:15.679
Don't chase him!

00:42:21.143 --> 00:42:22.936
Why? Did you lose him?

00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:25.064
With those long legs!

00:42:25.147 --> 00:42:27.191
You go that way, I'll go this way.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.360
-Call me when you find him.
-Sure.

00:42:48.712 --> 00:42:49.922
Where is the passage?

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.222
Why isn't he picking up?

00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:05.604
Where do you think you're running?

00:43:24.665 --> 00:43:26.083
Where is he?

00:43:27.209 --> 00:43:29.795
This way.

00:43:35.592 --> 00:43:37.219
I'll remove my hand now.

00:43:37.845 --> 00:43:39.555
Don't scream.

00:43:39.638 --> 00:43:41.098
Don't follow me.

00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:43.058
Got it?

00:44:02.619 --> 00:44:03.620
I'm going.

00:44:05.247 --> 00:44:06.415
Hurry, this way.

00:44:36.612 --> 00:44:37.988
Hurry up.

00:44:41.116 --> 00:44:42.785
Why is no one here?

00:44:43.535 --> 00:44:46.205
I'll go check the rehearsal.
The waiting room is that way.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.839
How is he the one late
to his own solo concert?

00:44:56.673 --> 00:45:00.427
-He has no manners at all.
-He's been busy lately.

00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:03.055
Solo promotions, variety shows, and radio…

00:45:04.598 --> 00:45:05.766
I feel bad for him.

00:45:05.849 --> 00:45:09.645
It seems like he's always carrying
everything by himself.

00:45:09.728 --> 00:45:10.729
Young-bin,

00:45:10.812 --> 00:45:13.273
you don't know
what that psycho's been doing, do you?

00:45:13.357 --> 00:45:14.650
What have I been doing?

00:45:15.984 --> 00:45:17.236
You're here?

00:45:17.986 --> 00:45:19.571
What's that psycho supposedly doing?

00:45:20.197 --> 00:45:21.740
Dating? Gambling?

00:45:21.823 --> 00:45:23.825
Drugs? What?

00:45:23.909 --> 00:45:25.577
Why are you so late?

00:45:25.661 --> 00:45:27.162
Can the main character be this late?

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.041
-Jae-hee!
-He showed up late and didn't say sorry.

00:45:32.417 --> 00:45:34.461
I'm sorry, happy now?

00:45:34.545 --> 00:45:36.213
You should say thanks too.

00:45:36.797 --> 00:45:40.175
You dragged us here
since you had no guests.

00:45:40.259 --> 00:45:41.635
Hey, come on.

00:45:41.718 --> 00:45:42.928
Seriously!

00:45:44.888 --> 00:45:46.306
It's true, right?

00:45:46.848 --> 00:45:49.726
You're using us because you can't handle
filling two hours by yourself.

00:45:51.478 --> 00:45:52.437
Aren't you?

00:45:52.521 --> 00:45:53.397
WAITING ROOM / GOLD BOYS (KANG WOO-SEONG,
CHOI JAE-HEE, LEE YOUNG-BIN)

00:45:54.064 --> 00:45:55.357
You're right.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.775
I'm using you.

00:45:57.359 --> 00:45:58.819
But you're no different, are you?

00:45:58.902 --> 00:46:01.488
Your contract's expiring,
you're getting zero offers,

00:46:02.322 --> 00:46:04.032
and the only way to survive is to renew.

00:46:04.116 --> 00:46:06.618
So you've been doing
whatever the company says

00:46:06.702 --> 00:46:08.370
and came all the way here.

00:46:08.453 --> 00:46:10.664
Trying to cling to me
for a few more years.

00:46:10.747 --> 00:46:12.666
What? What did you just say?

00:46:13.792 --> 00:46:14.960
Kang Woo-seong, see?

00:46:15.043 --> 00:46:16.461
This is why I said no.

00:46:18.255 --> 00:46:21.425
All right, I'm done.

00:46:23.552 --> 00:46:27.347
-I'm done being this lunatic's lackey.
-Hey, Jae-hee.

00:46:27.431 --> 00:46:28.849
-Hey!
-Yes, go!

00:46:29.725 --> 00:46:32.227
I'm glad I won't have to see
you ruin my stage.

00:46:33.437 --> 00:46:34.896
You are the one, screw it.

00:46:35.897 --> 00:46:37.983
You think you got a solo
because of your skill?

00:46:38.066 --> 00:46:41.194
No, but do you know why?

00:46:41.278 --> 00:46:43.614
It's all thanks to that cheap sob story
you keep selling.

00:46:43.697 --> 00:46:46.658
What's so great about suffering
under a mom who worked at a bar?

00:46:46.742 --> 00:46:48.744
Hey, Choi Jae-hee!

00:46:48.827 --> 00:46:52.164
-Hey, say it again.
-I'm telling the truth.

00:46:52.247 --> 00:46:54.916
You sell your sad past for pity points!

00:46:55.751 --> 00:46:57.294
-Say it again!
-Hold on.

00:46:58.086 --> 00:47:00.589
People don't love you.

00:47:00.672 --> 00:47:02.466
They just pity you.

00:47:03.008 --> 00:47:04.593
-What a bastard!
-Ra-ik!

00:47:04.676 --> 00:47:06.511
Stop!

00:47:06.595 --> 00:47:07.638
Wait a sec…

00:47:09.348 --> 00:47:12.017
-Come here!
-Choi Jae-hee!

00:47:13.644 --> 00:47:15.020
Calm down, Ra-ik.

00:47:15.103 --> 00:47:16.188
Move!

00:47:18.357 --> 00:47:19.941
Move out!

00:47:21.693 --> 00:47:23.570
-Please, stop!
-Move out!

00:47:24.196 --> 00:47:26.615
-Young-bin!
-Please stop fighting!

00:47:30.577 --> 00:47:31.703
Are you okay?

00:47:46.385 --> 00:47:48.136
Get inside, the concert starts soon.

00:47:48.929 --> 00:47:50.305
Take care of Ra-ik.

00:47:50.889 --> 00:47:51.765
Ra-ik, come on.

00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:06.446
SUCCESSFUL CONCERT
RECORD-BREAKING AUDIENCE

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.297
Why weren't the other members
there yesterday?

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.715
I was expecting a guest.

00:49:06.798 --> 00:49:09.468
They were supposed to come out,
but they fought and got hurt.

00:49:09.551 --> 00:49:12.763
I was working yesterday
and saw Ra-ik and Jae-hee fighting.

00:49:12.846 --> 00:49:15.682
They came to help his solo concert
and he behaves like that?

00:49:15.766 --> 00:49:16.600
His attitude hit rock bottom.

00:49:17.267 --> 00:49:18.560
What are they talking about?

00:49:20.437 --> 00:49:22.773
False rumor dissemination fine--

00:49:22.856 --> 00:49:23.774
MESSAGE

00:49:26.443 --> 00:49:27.527
LIKE

00:49:28.236 --> 00:49:29.571
Did you see the comments?

00:49:31.198 --> 00:49:32.574
Yeah.

00:49:32.657 --> 00:49:36.369
What is this Gold Boys discord rumor?
Is the Ra-ik personality controversy real?

00:49:36.453 --> 00:49:38.955
What? LIKE.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.124
How can even you…

00:49:43.794 --> 00:49:47.464
Discord rumors are nothing new.
Our boys really are close.

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.595
It's all over communities.

00:49:54.888 --> 00:49:57.224
They say Ra-ik beat them,
so they ended up in the ER.

00:49:58.934 --> 00:50:00.393
That makes no sense.

00:50:01.311 --> 00:50:06.775
GOLD BOYS RUMORS OF DISCORD
DO RA-IK CONTROVERSY COMPILATION

00:50:13.114 --> 00:50:14.699
DON'T STICK

00:50:14.783 --> 00:50:15.659
DON'T STICK TO ME

00:50:16.493 --> 00:50:17.369
EMBARRASSED

00:50:18.245 --> 00:50:19.246
This is…

00:50:20.372 --> 00:50:21.206
ANNOYED

00:50:21.289 --> 00:50:23.708
I want to defend him too, but…

00:50:23.792 --> 00:50:25.418
My eyes aren't blurred anymore…

00:50:26.169 --> 00:50:29.631
I don't know if the Ra-ik I loved
is even the real him.

00:50:31.424 --> 00:50:33.927
Sellpish, do you trust him?

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:34.886
DON'T ACT UP

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.389
Do you trust him 100%?

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.701
I trust him.

00:50:59.953 --> 00:51:02.372
I trust our Ra-ik

00:51:08.336 --> 00:51:14.426
I'm still me, just as I've always been

00:51:14.509 --> 00:51:19.139
Not once have I ever been
Anyone but myself

00:51:19.222 --> 00:51:21.391
I'm still

00:51:21.474 --> 00:51:24.102
The same as you know me

00:51:24.185 --> 00:51:26.354
There is nothing less

00:51:26.438 --> 00:51:29.399
There is nothing more

00:51:29.482 --> 00:51:30.775
Enough already.

00:51:30.859 --> 00:51:32.527
It's me

00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:34.195
The security office will call!

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.370
Woo-seong's here.

00:51:52.213 --> 00:51:54.215
Come in.

00:51:54.299 --> 00:51:56.092
What's all this alcohol?

00:51:56.176 --> 00:51:57.886
It's been a while for us guys.

00:52:00.138 --> 00:52:02.390
Hold on, then I'll bring out some snacks.

00:52:02.474 --> 00:52:04.351
It's fine, it's already past eight.

00:52:04.434 --> 00:52:06.186
It'll be quick.

00:52:06.269 --> 00:52:08.647
-Go before it gets later.
-All right.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:10.190
Stop chugging alcohol.

00:52:10.273 --> 00:52:13.401
If you whine tomorrow about heartburn,
I will throw bread chunks at you.

00:52:13.485 --> 00:52:15.070
All right.

00:52:15.779 --> 00:52:16.738
-Go.
-Yeah.

00:52:22.369 --> 00:52:24.079
He looks completely deflated.

00:52:26.665 --> 00:52:29.250
I'll cook hangover soup tomorrow,
so sleep over.

00:52:29.334 --> 00:52:30.710
-Be safe.
-Okay.

00:52:35.715 --> 00:52:38.927
Why are you here? What about the boys?
What about Jae-hee?

00:52:39.761 --> 00:52:41.638
So you do worry, huh?

00:52:43.306 --> 00:52:46.768
I worry he might still be alive
when I should have finished him.

00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:49.854
You came to the hospital.
I know everything.

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:03.076
You rushed over after the concert
because you were worried.

00:53:03.159 --> 00:53:04.577
You didn't even go to the after party.

00:53:04.661 --> 00:53:07.455
You could've at least said hello
since you came, seriously.

00:53:08.081 --> 00:53:11.459
You were all talking behind my back
so how could I show up there?

00:53:11.543 --> 00:53:13.420
Luckily, he was not badly hurt.

00:53:13.503 --> 00:53:15.296
Just a cast, he will be discharged soon.

00:53:21.761 --> 00:53:23.805
Jae-hee really feels sorry.

00:53:24.639 --> 00:53:27.350
He knows he should never have said--

00:53:30.603 --> 00:53:32.480
This is expensive, chew it and swallow.

00:53:54.419 --> 00:53:57.881
Hey, this tastes just like that, right?

00:53:59.382 --> 00:54:02.010
When we lived in the semi-basement room…

00:54:03.595 --> 00:54:05.138
the one with a month past its expiration.

00:54:05.722 --> 00:54:07.766
Yeah, that chunky milk.

00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:10.101
-It tastes exactly the same.
-Right.

00:54:10.643 --> 00:54:13.021
You drank it
because you didn't want to waste it,

00:54:13.104 --> 00:54:14.814
and then right before the stage…

00:54:22.572 --> 00:54:25.158
Back then, we were passionate.

00:54:27.368 --> 00:54:28.703
No matter how sick we were,

00:54:28.787 --> 00:54:33.416
all we wanted was to be on the stage.

00:54:42.926 --> 00:54:46.346
Ra-ik, if it's too hard for you…

00:54:46.429 --> 00:54:47.722
If it's too hard, then what?

00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:52.352
You know about my mom.

00:54:55.063 --> 00:54:57.982
Hey, we really need to work hard.

00:54:58.066 --> 00:55:02.529
Kids these days think
Gold Boys is the name of an animation.

00:55:07.075 --> 00:55:08.284
So,

00:55:09.869 --> 00:55:13.248
you are thinking
of continuing Gold Boys then?

00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:16.084
Didn't you see

00:55:17.335 --> 00:55:18.461
my album performance?

00:55:20.171 --> 00:55:21.840
Jae-hee was right.

00:55:22.799 --> 00:55:25.301
I cannot do it alone.

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:28.721
People love

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:31.099
Ra-ik of Gold Boys,

00:55:31.683 --> 00:55:34.727
not just Do Ra-ik.

00:55:36.312 --> 00:55:39.816
So I have to remain Gold Boys to the end.

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:45.738
Stop the depressing talk, let's drink.

00:56:35.079 --> 00:56:36.206
Woo-seong.

00:57:25.755 --> 00:57:27.799
Woo-seong

00:57:28.341 --> 00:57:32.887
Woo-seong!

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.056
Woo-seong!

00:57:38.142 --> 00:57:40.186
Open your eyes!

00:57:40.812 --> 00:57:41.938
What happened to you?

00:57:43.189 --> 00:57:44.440
Woo-seong.

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:46.943
What am I supposed to do?

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:49.487
Woo-seong!

00:58:18.933 --> 00:58:20.059
There are days like that.

00:58:20.893 --> 00:58:23.730
Days when I dreamed about you…

00:58:27.233 --> 00:58:28.484
and on those days,

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:32.155
I can't help falling
into foolish little fantasies.

00:58:36.701 --> 00:58:41.873
Like accidentally sharing a table
with you at a random restaurant,

00:58:47.337 --> 00:58:51.257
or bumping into you
alone in an empty, late-night theater.

00:58:53.843 --> 00:58:56.763
Just imagining it makes me happy.

00:58:59.015 --> 00:59:01.601
FRESH MILK

00:59:07.398 --> 00:59:09.484
Ra-ik is at Gangseo Police Station
right now.

00:59:17.659 --> 00:59:19.952
RA-IK MURDERED WOO-SEONG?

00:59:27.585 --> 00:59:30.963
Shock spreads as Gold Boys member

00:59:31.047 --> 00:59:34.092
Kang Woo-seong was found dead.

00:59:34.175 --> 00:59:37.762
The core of the incident
is that his body was found

00:59:37.845 --> 00:59:42.475
at fellow member Ra-ik's residence
in Gangseong, Seoul.

00:59:42.558 --> 00:59:43.935
Police confirmed

00:59:44.018 --> 00:59:46.604
that the two were together
on the day of the incident,

00:59:46.688 --> 00:59:49.982
and have identified him
as the primary suspect.

00:59:50.066 --> 00:59:52.568
He was arrested on site

00:59:52.652 --> 00:59:54.779
and is currently
at the Gangseo Police Station.

00:59:54.862 --> 00:59:56.531
And I imagine,

00:59:57.657 --> 01:00:00.910
just once, a miracle like that

01:00:01.786 --> 01:00:04.539
could happen to me too.

01:00:05.957 --> 01:00:07.333
POLICE STATION

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:08.668
LAWYER'S ID

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:18.219
LAWYER'S RECEPTION ROOM

01:00:35.987 --> 01:00:37.029
But…

01:00:38.698 --> 01:00:40.450
even if I imagined it

01:00:41.576 --> 01:00:43.786
a hundred times, a thousand times,

01:00:45.204 --> 01:00:46.205
I never imagined

01:00:53.796 --> 01:00:56.048
that we would meet…

01:00:58.718 --> 01:01:00.970
as a lawyer and a murder suspect.

01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:54.982
You tell me, who is Do Ra-ik?

01:01:55.066 --> 01:01:57.944
Why are you so obsessed with this case?

01:01:58.027 --> 01:01:59.737
There are many contradictions in the case.

01:02:00.279 --> 01:02:01.656
There's definitely something there.

01:02:02.281 --> 01:02:04.659
Criminal Division 3, Seoul Central
District Prosecutors' Office

01:02:04.742 --> 01:02:05.827
Kwak Byung-gyun.

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:08.663
Guys like Kang Woo-seong
are always unlucky jerks.

01:02:08.746 --> 01:02:11.082
What do you mean you dropped Ra-ik's case?

01:02:11.165 --> 01:02:12.500
He's going to trial without a lawyer.

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:13.751
Do you realize?

01:02:13.835 --> 01:02:15.044
But what if it really was me?

01:02:15.586 --> 01:02:17.672
No matter how hard I try,
I can't remember.

01:02:17.755 --> 01:02:22.760
