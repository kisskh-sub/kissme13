[Strange Chronicles of Tang]

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.030
[Episode 16]

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.030
[Just and Selfless]

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.000
I remember now.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.940
Back then, the Crimson Pact
was scattered among civilians,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.870
but in Chang'an,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.920
there was indeed a contact point.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.110
Although I've never been there,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.870
I believe

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.200
it was located
where the Relief-from-Woes Shop is.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.340
Mr. Fei,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.520
you're just a doctor.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.020
You have no connection
to the Crimson Pact.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.430
You shouldn't know so much.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.160
Yes, yes.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.920
[Just and Selfless]

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.720
Right, right.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.520
From beginning to end,

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.670
Ruiqiu was never involved in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.620
the evil deeds
of the Relief-from-Woes Shop.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.180
She was just

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.440
an unfortunate woman.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.229
Xijun.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.330
Did you tell her

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.310
that I intended to release her?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.880
She doesn't want to leave.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.620
I dance the Rain Master's Dance

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.150
to find relief from my woes.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.870
But now...

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.490
they're all dead.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.060
My woes can no longer be relieved.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.990
I have no desire
to dance on stage anymore.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.600
If even this prison cannot hold me,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.530
then death is my only path.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.610
Perhaps

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.160
Ruiqiu will never

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.230
forget all of this.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.760
But maybe she can get back on her feet

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.710
and return to Xiuzhen District
as the Madam Master of Rain.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.990
For now, though,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.140
it's better to let her

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.540
stay in Yongzhou Prison.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.270
[Fair Winds and Gentle Rains]

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.630
Without the Master of Rain,

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.700
Xiuzhen District isn't a big deal.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.320
After all,
other districts have Masters of Rain.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.120
When it rains,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.390
surely some drops must fall

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.850
in Xiuzhen District, too.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.980
It's just that

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.740
no one will be here

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.020
to lead our dances anymore.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.540
How will we find Relief-from-Woes now?

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.420
Exactly!

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.910
I haven't danced for so long

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.140
and my whole body aches.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.630
I can't feel happy, even for a moment.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.630
Though the dancing was good,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.430
it was far inferior to Ruiqiu's.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.240
Magistrate Xin, your words

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.710
sound rather resentful.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.790
This is my last complaint.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.980
I'm still a magistrate,

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.630
but I've been demoted

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.860
to the most remote county in Bashu.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.910
As you can see,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.410
I'm about to depart.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.209
Xin, are you going alone...

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.480
without any attendants?

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.000
Do you think I'm a corrupt official?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.950
I have no money,

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.130
and I'm going to such a remote place,

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.660
who would want to follow me?

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.350
However,

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.909
having served as an official in Chang'an

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.510
has made my life worthwhile.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.460
The essence of being an official

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.030
is to serve the people.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.909
Though I haven't done well,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.090
I've tried my best.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.780
The anxieties I once harbored

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.350
have vanished with today's demotion—

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.220
all gone like smoke.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.650
you have earned my newfound respect.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.510

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.820
What is a Gulou Pastry?

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.830
It's a delicacy from the west.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.530
A large stuffed flatbread

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.800
with layers of lamb filling

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.030
spread evenly inside the bread,

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.540
sprinkled with pepper
and fermented beans between layers,

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.000
topped with sesame seeds,

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.090
brushed with ghee,

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.010
and then baked.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.800
I see you're an expert.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:07.770
Su,

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.090
I must apologize.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.110
While in Hanzhou Prefecture,

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.110
I didn't treat you to this delicacy.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.840
No matter.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.670
It's not too late to try it in Chang'an.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.300
Our shop

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.870
makes only 10 Gulou Pastries daily,

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.550
all reserved for officials and nobles.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.540
But today one customer didn't show up,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.600
so we have one left.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.030
Shall I bring it for you both?

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.660
Hold on.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.920
Let me ask first.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.390
How much is one?

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.270
I'll give you a discount.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.780
90 coins for one.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.940
90 coins...

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.540
Ma,

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.250
perhaps we should come back another time.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.800
Too expensive for you?

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.510
Lamb prices have gone up again.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.630
One Gulou Pastry

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.850
requires over half a kilo of lamb.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.480
The ghee and pepper

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.950
are not cheap either.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.900
It's not about the price.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.820
I'm just short on funds today.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.060
Why invite guests if you can't afford it?

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:00.660
Come back!

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.150
That leftover Gulou Pastry of yours,

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.470
we don't want it.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.710
Tomorrow,

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.700
make 10 fresh ones for me.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.820
Extra pepper,

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.870
extra lamb.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.870
Tomorrow?

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.420
What time will you come?

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.940
I'll prepare them in advance.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.140
After they're ready,

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.420
deliver them directly
to Wannian County Office.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.010
I'm treating it to
County Sheriff Su here.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.270
County Sheriff?

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.870
I apologize for my rudeness earlier.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:30.270
Ma,

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.070
please put your money away.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.740
No need to get upset with him.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:34.700
No,

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.820
I must order 10 Gulou Pastries.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.220
I insist on treating you.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:37.990
After all,

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.640
I've been consulting you.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.390
Consider it my thanks.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.180
But I can't eat that many.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.840
Five of them, then.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.230
You can share with your colleagues.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.760
The other five,

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.110
deliver to Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.500
It'll be my treat to

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.430
Judicial Officer Lu Lingfeng.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.660
These are all big shots.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.620
Noted.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.750
Su.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.910
Strychnine.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.330
You must be hungry.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.840
Are you asking me?

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:29.420
Yes.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.560
But I don't know you.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.060
As long as I know you.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.540
You can

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.270
have this.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.490
It's the aroma of lamb,

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.020
and the fragrance of cheese.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.580
Could it be Gulou Pastry?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.630
You really know your food.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:49.920
Take it.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.570
It really is Gulou Pastry.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.030
The victim was a beggar.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.990
No one knows his name.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.110
He died in a terrible way.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.230
His body and limbs were put together,

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.390
bent into a bow shape.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.150
It looks like he was poisoned
by strychnine.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.540
I've sent someone to get Coroner Su Chan

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.670
to examine the body.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:28.550
What is this?

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.630
It smells delicious.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.560
It's similar to the Gulou Pastry
we had the other day.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:38.580
You know what,

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.980
it really smells like it.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:40.910
Mr. Su,

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.270
it's the delicacy

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.420
your friend had specially delivered

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.310
that day.
