JUJU SCROLL
MOVIE VERSION

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.170
I heard that if you eat mochi
before going to see a movie,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.490
it makes you less likely to go to the bathroom during.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.010
Huh? I heard eating plenty of salt was good for that.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.880
Want some popcorn?

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.350
I told you to get the caramel kind!

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.440
You didn't contribute a single yen,
so you don't get any right to decide.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.670
That's outrageous!

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.860
Oh, HR! Oh, HR!

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.340
The power harassment here is awful,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.040
so send a different long-haired guy.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.050
One you might find working in a beauty parlor!

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.350
- Send a different wannabe host too.
- Hey!

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.860
By the way,
the theory is that you're less,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.660
likely to use the bathroom because the digest of mochi produces

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.010
glycogen, which draws water into cells,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.060
but there's no proof to it.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.480
That's our witch doctor for you!

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.680
I hope you get sent to Black Jack!

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.910
Black Jack graduated medical school,
so why is he unlicensed anyway?

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.070
I guess we'll learn the answer to that in this movie.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.230
Believe me or don't, it's up to you.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.280
I should probably mention that the "witch" part
of "witch doctor" also refers to actual jujutsu sorcery.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.080
Seriously?!

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.130
Things were busy that summer.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.460
The frequent disasters of the
past year probably played a role,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.610
but cursed spirits were
springing up like maggots.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.080
Exorcise, absorb.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.640
Over and over.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.360
Exorcise.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.900
Absorb.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.520
No one else understands

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.820
what cursed spirits taste like.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.060
It's like swallowing a dirty rag that's
been used to clean up shit and vomit.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.900
Exorcise.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.870
Absorb.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.250
"What I witnessed isn't uncommon."

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.190
"I understood the ugliness of the masses,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.600
and still chose to be a
jujutsu sorcerer who saves others."

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.340
That's what I've been telling
myself ever since that day.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.610
Ever since that day.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.630
JUNE 6TH 2006

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.420
Apparently, this used to be
the home of the president

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.020
of a company managing a local
chain of barbecue restaurants.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.520
However, in July of last year,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.180
the mad cow disease breakout dealt
a fatal blow to his restaurants,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.700
so he committed suicide with his family
after they were buried under vast debt.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.660
From then on, local rumors claimed
the president's home was haunted,

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.670
so local school kids, college students
from outside the prefecture,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.260
job-hoppers, and others would visit
it as part of a test of courage,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.130
and subsequently go missing.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.760
Those rumors brought about more rumors,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.850
and the damage just continued to spread.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.180
Rumors do tend to spread rather
quickly around haunted spots.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.680
They can spread at an unbelievable
pace nowadays, thanks to the Internet.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.450
This all just means even more
work for us jujutsu sorcerers.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.210
In addition to that, three grade school kids
went missing on their way home from school.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.700
There's also a high chance
the families, police, colleagues,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.460
and friends who trace the paths
of those who disappeared

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.820
will reach the mansion and
become victims themselves.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.710
We have to sever the root of
this issue as soon as possible.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.050
HQ sent us to investigate because
they reached the same conclusion.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.010
Warning!
Entering These Premises Is Forbidden!
Many Have Gone Missing!

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.670
They're even paying my fees,
which aren't cheap.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.690
Did you overcharge them again?

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.160
You make it sound so bad.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.460
Call it negotiation.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.340
We're here.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.140
Let's go, then.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.340
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.900
Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.090
Purify that—

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.620
There's no need for a veil.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.540
Huh?

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.000
I don't sense the presence of any Curses.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.830
The cause is almost certainly
inside the building.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.580
You can cast the veil later if we
end up attacking it from outside.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.300
...True.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.510
It's unlocked.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.700
Seems like something's blocking the door.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.470
What is all this?

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.010
Mei-san.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.100
It's here.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.650
And it's all around us, too.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.410
Let's get going.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.250
I don't need that, but you do, right?

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.570
Thank you.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.750
All right.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.260
I-Incredible.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.010
Oh, it still has electricity.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.560
For now, let's have a
look inside the building.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.370
I'll take this floor,

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.040
you take the second.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.570
Huh? All by myself?

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.270
Is there a problem with that?

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.900
N-No, i-it's fine.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.650
Off you go, then.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.100
Okay.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.340
This is the last one.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.860
You could be the next big Scream Queen.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.940
Jeez!

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.340
Please don't startle me like that!

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.440
You got startled all on your own.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.110
Are you done exploring the first floor?

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.820
This is the first floor.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:49.830
Huh?

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.620
I was walking down
the first floor hallway.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.020
What? But...

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.740
I know I entered a room
at the end of the hallway...

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.790
A box of candy.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.930
A bag of potato chips.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:07.970
Cans.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.810
A backpack.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.470
A sweatshirt.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.280
I've already seen this three times.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.260
And see these marks? I made
them on my way through here.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.500
It would seem that we're already
in the belly of the beast.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.730
Huh?

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.860
For real?

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.960
How long is this hallway?

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.120
We've been moving for thirty minutes,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.380
so about four kilometers so far.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.340
It's not an innate domain, is it?

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.120
It's not.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.480
Those are manifestations
of the spirit's mindscape.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.420
Which means...

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.180
This is a barrier.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.770
Correct.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.410
Most likely, the victims
were trapped inside this

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.510
and then killed by the cursed spirit.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.860
Though, considering the
use of this technique,

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.450
the cursed spirit itself should be weak.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.360
So if we can just escape this barrier...

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.040
Now, quiz time.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.410
How would you break this, Utahime?

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.180
This hallway is repeating itself.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.020
At first...

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.070
I thought...

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.380
I'm surprised you could touch them.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.240
...it was shaped like a donut.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:51.340
But we passed by four of
the marks you made, right?

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.990
When I calculated how many
paces apart they were, I got...

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.600
122,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.740
203,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.060
157,

00:10:59.060 --> 00:10:59.990
and 270 paces.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.340
So the spacing between marks was random.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.960
I see.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.510
The interval between
repetitions isn't standardized.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.020
Which means that, most likely...

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.100
this barrier is patching spaces together.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.680
So if we both run down the hallway
at top speed, then at some point...

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.780
It'll break.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.690
Close. Ninety points.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:32.700
D'oh.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.940
What's the remaining ten?

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:40.830
When we run, we do so in opposite
directions at the same time.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.370
I get it!

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.430
So my patching theory was correct,

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.200
and if we quickly advance
in different directions,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.490
that makes it harder for the cursed
spirit to hold the barrier together.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.490
And once we have that opening,
we might be able to get out.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.640
One hundred points.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.140
Then, with that settled...

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.980
If this works, I'll be expecting a promotion.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.850
How much do you have in savings?

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.670
What?

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.020
Never mind. I'll think about it.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.080
Right!

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:13.440
Okay... Ready, set...

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.460
Go!

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.990
We did it!

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.250
Wait, wha—

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.640
I'm here to save you,

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.360
Utahime.

Nah, you wouldn't cry, Mei-san.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.330
You're strong.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.650

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.320
Gojo! You listen here!

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.740
I don't need your hel—

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.630
Don't swallow it.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.650
I'll absorb it later.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:48.500
Satoru, it's not nice to pick on the weak.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.250
JUJUTSU HIGH
SECOND YEAR
GETO SUGURU

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.490
What kind of idiot picks on the strong?

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.860
You're the one fanning the flames
like it comes naturally, Geto-kun.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.330
Utahime-senpai!

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.640
Are you okay?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.890
Shoko!
JUJUTSU HIGH
SECOND YEAR
IEIRI SHOKO

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.010
I was worried about you.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.020
We hadn't heard from you for two whole days.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.020
Shoko!

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:17.950
Shoko! Don't let yourself
turn out like those two!

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.530
I won't turn into trash like them.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.940
SAID TRASH

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.010
The path Utahime walked is falling apart.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:25.510
Shut up.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.530
Wait, two days?

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.620
Ah, was the cursed spirit's barrier
one of those that messes with time?

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.840
They're rare, but they
do happen now and then.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.730
I thought it was odd,
since Mei-san was with you.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.810
Seems like it was.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:42.940
Something the matter?

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.350
No. Just realized that means
it was actually two days' labor,

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:52.030
and that means extra fees paid out to me.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.440
She's planning to overcharge again.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.570
That aside, what about the veil, you three?

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.340
{\an8}Next, the explosion that occurred
yesterday in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.540
One of you three said they
would cast the veil themselves

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.870
and left your assistant
supervisor behind, didn't you?

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880
And then you forgot the veil.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.410
FIRST GRADE
SORCERER
YAGA MASAMICHI

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.760
Come forward.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.260
Sensei!

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.120
Why don't we stop this hunt for the culprit?!

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.300
So it was you, Satoru.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:22.920
DISCIPLINE

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:28.340
Is a veil that necessary in the first place?

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.980
It's not like it matters if
normies see or not, right?

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.730
They can't see cursed spirits
or cursed techniques, anyway.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.410
Of course it's not good for them to see.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.520
The strongest deterrent
against the outbreak

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.710
of a cursed spirit is the
mental calm of the populace.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.510
That's exactly why we have to conceal

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.200
the threats they can't even
see as much as possible.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.560
And that's not all—

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.460
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.930
Looking out for the weak
is so exhausting, honestly.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.190
Survival of the weakest.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.760
That's how a society should be.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.859
The weak help each other and
discourage any who are too strong.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.430
Listen, Satoru.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.010
Jujutsu exists to protect
non-jujutsu sorcerers.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.810
Is that your moral argument?

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.030
I hate moral arguments.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.400
What?

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.120
Assigning reasons and
responsibility to strength

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.830
is what those who are weak do.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.570
Quit making yourself feel
better by spouting bullshit.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.690
Blegh.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.500
Run for it.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.770
Want to take this outside, Satoru?

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.800
You feeling lonely?

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.180
Go by yourself.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.910
How long are you going
to keep fooling around?

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.570
Where did Shoko go?

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:03.910
Who knows?

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.070
Bathroom, probably.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.070
Whatever.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.900
This mission is being assigned to you two.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.830
What are those faces for?

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.410
Nothing.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.790
Frankly, I think it's too much for you,

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.240
but Tengen-sama asked for you specifically.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.090
Your mission has two goals.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:25.990
The Star Plasma Vessel

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.440
is the one compatible with Tengen-sama.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.560
You are to escort that girl and erase her.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.570
Escort a brat and erase her?

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.480
That's right.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.040
Have you finally gone senile?

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.820
It is spring.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.570
He's probably got his head full
with being the next principal.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.340
Jokes aside, though—

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.830
{\an8}I'll be the one to decide
if I let that off as a joke.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.720
Is this about renewing
Tengen-sama's technique?

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.240
What's that?

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.830
What?

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.550
Tengen-sama possesses the
cursed technique of Immortality,

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.070
but it is not Eternal Youth.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.780
It wouldn't be an issue
if all he did was get older,

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.130
but after his body ages to a certain point,

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.880
the cursed technique
begins rewriting his body.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.780
Evolution.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.310
He'll cease to be human and become
a higher form of existence.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.220
What's wrong with that?

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.000
Sounds cool.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.630
According to Tengen-sama,

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.670
those who reach that state
of being have no will.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.070
It means Tengen-sama would
cease to be Tengen-sama.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.820
TOKYO JUJUTSU HIGH SCHOOL
All the jujutsu schools,

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.270
the barriers that form the
foundation of jujutsu society,

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.640
the many barrier techniques
of the assistant supervisors...

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.020
They're all being strengthened by Tengen-sama.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.590
Without the aid of his power,

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.610
we could hardly maintain security
or clean up after missions.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.420
In the worst-case scenario,

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.930
Tengen-sama could even become
a threat to mankind.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.250
That's why, every 500 years,
he finds the Plasma Star Vessel—

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.650
someone who is compatible with him—

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.810
and assimilates them,
overwriting the information of their body.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.050
By renewing his body,

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.570
he resets his cursed
technique back to the start

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.330
and avoids Evolution.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:07.740
I get it.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.290
It would be fine if he turned
into MetalGreymon,

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.780
but we can't have him
becoming SkullGreymon.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.570
So we have him start over from Koromon.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.050
What? Yeah, sure, that works.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:23.360
The Star Plasma Vessel's
location has been leaked.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.640
Right now, there are two major
groups after the young girl's life.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.290
One is the Curse User Group Q,

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.780
which seeks to upend jujutsu society
with Tengen-sama's rampage.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.320
The other is the Star Religious
Group, also known as the

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.160
"Time Vessel Association,"
which worships Tengen-sama as a god.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:47.430
Tengen-sama will assimilate the
Star Plasma Vessel two days from now.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:52.300
You are to protect the girl until then and
ensure that she reaches Tengen-sama!

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.290
If you fail, the effects will ripple
throughout even normal society!

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.870
Don't forget that!

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.120
Yeah, but you know,

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.010
I get why Curse User Group Q
would be after her,

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.300
but why would this Star Religious
Group want to kill a brat?

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.170
Their object of worship is
the pure form of Tengen-sama.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:11.980
Allowing the Star Plasma Vessel—

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.730
in their minds, an impurity—
to blend into him is unforgivable.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.370
The Star Religious Group is an
organization of non-sorcerers.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.510
I don't think we need to pay them any mind.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.180
The ones to be wary of are Q.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.350
Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.190
We're the strongest, after all.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:31.300
That's why Tengen-sama asked
for us specifically, right?

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.650
What is it?

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.680
You know, Satoru...

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.970
I've been wanting to say this for a while,

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.500
but you should stop being
so full of yourself.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.330
Huh?!

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.090
Especially when you're
addressing your superiors.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.690
We might end up meeting
Tengen-sama, after all.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.340
You should be more polite and humble.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.570
You'd scare your juniors less, too.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:57.300
Hah!

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.890
Screw that!

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.040
Come on, Satoru.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.260
Whatever.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.810
I'll bring it up again later.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.430
Coming.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:10.810
Huh?

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:18.820
You alive?

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.370
I am, at least.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.330
You think we'll be blamed
if the brat died from that?

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.620
Ah

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.180
Don't blame me.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.300
If you must hate someone, hate Tengen.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.810
Q
COMBATANT
KOKUN

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:41.560
Wha—

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.430
Would you please stop making us stand out?

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.520
We just got chewed out
for that this morning.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.980
So this girl is the Star Plasma Vessel?

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.610
I know those uniforms. You're
sorcerers from Jujutsu High, right?

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.070
Hand over the kid.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:57.660
Or I'll kill you.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.690
Can't hear you.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.700
Come closer and talk.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.430
Man, barely safe.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.460
Wonderful.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.460
You're Gojo Satoru, right?

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:13.750
Q
COMBATANT
BAYER

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.460
You're famous.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.150
I hear you're strong.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.920
Let me find out if the rumors are true.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.770
I'm down for that, but let's set some rules.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:25.980
Rules?

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.410
I don't want to get yelled
at for going overboard.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.820
So if you cry and apologize,
I won't kill you.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.280
That's our rule.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.880
Damn brat.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.340
It's started.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:44.000
The Star Religious Group doesn't have the
power to fight against jujutsu sorcerers.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.910
But they can pay very well.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.690
That I guarantee.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.050
How about it, Zen'in?

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.190
Want to get in on the assassination
of the Star Plasma Vessel?

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.980
I'm not a Zen'in anymore.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.800
I took my wife's name.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.770
It's Fushiguro now.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.790
But sure.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.040
Count me in.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.450
Please!

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:38.040
Please listen to me!

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:39.750
I was wrong!

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:40.750
I'm sorry!

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.950
I'm really sorry!

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.750
Let's kiss!

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:44.130
Huh?!

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.170
Let's kiss!

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.680
I'll pull out of this job!

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.340
I'll quit being a curse user, too!

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.650
Let's kiss!

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.100
C'mon, kiss!

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.310
Of course I'll quit Q, too!

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:00.310
I know! I'll go back to the
countryside and farm rice!

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.730
I know you can hear me!

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.280
Like a curse user could cut it as a farmer.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.950
You can hear me!

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.280
Damn student acting all condescending!

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:11.530
{\an8}Lick, lick.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.870
But Bayer-san is here, too!

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.200
He's Q's strongest combatant!

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.000
He'll take care of you and these things!

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Hey.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.500
Is this your "Bayer"?

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:23.500
Huh?

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.170
That's him.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.930
Q
DEPARTURE OF TOP COMBATANT,
BAYER, LEADS TO ORGANIZATION'S COLLAPSE

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.980
{\an8}And all the boats are off at once.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.230
{\an8}From the inside, we have Numbers
1, 2, 4, 5, 3, and 6 starting the race.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.980
{\an8}They're off with a beautiful straight shot.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.490
And just what are you doing after
suddenly disappearing on me?

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.290
Getting more money.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.870
I've never seen you win once.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.870
What about your job?

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.290
Oh, give it a rest.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.920
You're talking like I'm unemployed.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.210
Because you are.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.600
As a mediator, it's my duty to report
how the job's going to the client.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.970
I'm up against the Gojo clan's kid.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.390
I wouldn't be able to do anything
if I just popped up in front of him.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.860
I have to wear him down
using some idiots first.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.940
You go do your own damn job.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.730
Already did, dumbass.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.750
What were you thinking,
letting go of the entire deposit?

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.530
I told you, wearing him down.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.240
Don't you worry. All that
money will come back to me.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.200
Just like with this race.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.290
{\an8}Number 6, Hateno, crosses the line first!

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.500
{\an8}Number 1, Doguchi, finishes next!

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.670
{\an8}Following them in third is Number 2, Matsuda.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:50.210
{\an8}In fourth is Number 4, Nakaoka.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.300
Tsk.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.300
{\an8}In fifth is Number 3, Tanaka.
You're not cut out for making easy money.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.510
{\an8}In sixth is Number 5,
Okazaki, finishing last!

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.680
{\an8}Number 6, Hateno, has given us an amazing
comeback to watch in his first race!

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.720
I'm counting on you, Sorcerer Killer.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:00.010
{\an8}That was our third race of the day.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.430
Oh, right.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.560
How's Megumi doing?

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:16.570
Who's that?

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.130
Should we get her to a doctor?

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.590
I wish I could use reverse
cursed energy like Shoko.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.090
Yeah, that's impossible.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.840
I can't understand a word she says about it.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.390
You go "fwoo," then "hyoi."

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:34.430
Fwoo, hyoi. Get it?

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.140
You've got no sense for this.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.150
You're awake.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.240
You scum!

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.500
If you want to kill me,
you'll be the one to die first!

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.920
Riko-chan, calm down.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.440
We're not with the group that attacked you.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.670
Liar!

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.090
You have the face of a liar!

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.800
Your bangs are weird, too!

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.560
GRIND

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.390
This is disrespectful!

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.940
P-Please stop it!

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.150
Kuroi!

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.480
Young lady, these men are our allies.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.570
Kuroi, what are you riding on?

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.700
This is thanks to Bangs Guy's technique.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.950
Could you please not call me that?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.750
It's Curse Manipulation.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.210
As the name suggests, I can absorb
and manipulate cursed spirits.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.460
This brat is more aggressive
than I expected.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.960
I was trying to figure out
how to be considerate,

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.550
thinking she'd be more sentimental
about the assimilation thing.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:50.880
Hmph!

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.680
A commoner's way of thinking!

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.510
Huh?!

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.300
Listen up!

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.020
Tengen-sama is me, and I am Tengen-sama!

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.820
Some might mistake
assimilation for death, as you do,

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.480
but there's a big difference!

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.780
I might become Tengen-sama
through the assimilation,

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.360
but Tengen-sama will also become me!

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.740
My will! My heart!

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.100
My soul will continue to live
on after the assimilation!

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.250
You changed your home screen?

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.540
To Inoue Waka.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.710
Listen to me!

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.340
I bet you don't have many
friends if you talk like that.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.340
We won't have to feel bad sending you off.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.590
I talk normally at school!

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.140
School!

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.600
Kuroi, what time is it?!

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.720
It's not yet noon. But I think going to school—

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.560
Be quiet!

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.350
I said I'm going, and I'm going!

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.810
Huh?!

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.700
Surely it'd be safer to head
back to Jujutsu High at once!

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:53.780
As much as I want to do that,
this is an order from Tengen-sama.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.620
He said to fulfill all of
Amanai Riko's demands.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.160
Tsk.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.830
Lax upbringing at its finest.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.050
Don't be like that, Satoru.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:09.380
Despite what she may say,

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.670
after the assimilation, she'll spend
her whole life as Tengen-sama

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.180
in the deepest floor of Jujutsu High,
as the foundation of all barriers.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.770
She won't be able to see her friends,
family, or anyone precious to her ever again.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.270
Riko!

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.120
Our next class is in a different room.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.680
Okay!

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.520
Let her do what she wants.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.990
That's part of our mission.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.490
Riko-sama has no family.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:38.470
They were in an accident when she was little.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.290
I've taken care of her ever since then.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.340
So I want her to at least have
what time she can with her friends.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.000
So you're her family, then.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.500
Yes.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.010
Suguru.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:58.930
How're the cursed spirits you
sent to watch over her?

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.980
I just wish I could share my senses
with them like Mei-san does.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.850
Even so, they'll let us know as
soon as anything unusual happens.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.110
Satoru.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.070
Hurry to Riko-chan's side.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.980
Huh?

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.520
Two have been exorcised.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.320
{\an8}Who will be the ace of the next generation?

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.990
{\an8}This will be an important match
to help us find out.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.540
{\an8}Number 6's final position
is finally starting to solidify.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.080
{\an8}Now, the fifth race, the one all eyes
are focused on, is about to begin.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.660
AMANAI RIKO
RENCHOKU GIRLS' ACADEMY
DEAD OR ALIVE

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:43.890
Where's Amanai?!

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.930
She has music this period,

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.020
so either the music room or the chapel.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.650
Chapel?!

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.070
It changes depending on what
the music teacher wants.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:53.940
Also, this is a missionary school.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.860
Satoru, you take the chapel.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.490
Kuroi-san, take the music room.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.360
I'll take the two unknowns.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.900
Roger that.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:02.830
I told you not to follow me!

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:05.370
What if my friends see you?!

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.000
I'm sorry.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.830
I even told her to text us
when she was on the move.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:13.920
This is why I told that brat to stay within
eyeshot so we could protect her!

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.050
{\an8}And they're off.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.510
{\an8}Numbers 1 and 2 make a good start,
favoring the inside.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.090
{\an8}Number 3 trails a bit behind.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:22.600
What?

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:22.970
{\an8}Taking the lead at the first mark of
the first lap is Number 2, Yamazaki.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.140
They didn't go back to Jujutsu High?

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:25.970
Lucky me.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.410
{\an8}Behind him is Number 1, Masaki.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:27.660
{\an8}They're followed by Number 3, Kawano.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.600
Now the ones drawn to the bounty will
be reasonable fools instead of just fools.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.730
{\an8}Then comes Number 4, Nomiya, Number 5,
Mifune, and in last is Number 6, Funegi.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:33.070
Are you sure?

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.400
About what?

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:39.260
The bounty is the thirty-million deposit
that the Star Religious Group paid you.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.780
If they kill the Star Plasma Vessel,
the deposit is gone,

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.540
and worst-case, you might not
get the full reward, either.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.250
They might start saying
they could have posted

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.750
a bounty from the start
instead of hiring you.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:53.730
Gojo Satoru is with the girl.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.090
He's the first in several
centuries to possess both

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.170
the Six Eyes and the Limitless technique.

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:02.340
No one can kill the Star Plasma
Vessel as long as he's nearby.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.860
Not even you?

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.790
{\an8}Number 3, Kawano,
is making a rushing comeback!

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.650
{\an8}He's pulled into first place!

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.260
Who knows?

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:20.820
{\an8}He's managed to take the lead twice now.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.030
For now, we'll leave the bounty
up for another 47 hours,

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:25.450
{\an8}This race has been
filled with ups and downs.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:25.780
{\an8}Can Number 3, Kawano,
defend his position at the top?

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.540
and let the fools wear down Gojo
and the sorcerers with him.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.710
{\an8}The race is now entering its third lap.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:39.800
Hey!

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.470
Hold it right there!

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.440
Nah, never mind.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.980
They won't be able to kill the
Star Plasma Vessel, of course,

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.480
so they're working for free.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.900
It's a good thing you put
that time limit on it.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.700
The curse users are
quickly flocking to them.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.660
That's not the only reason.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.280
Eh?

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.950
Just talking to myself.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:09.159
{\an8}What?!

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:13.630
{\an8}Number 3, Kawano, just lost his balance,
and Number 2, Yamazaki, is passing him!

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:13.920
{\an8}Number 3 has drifted far to the outside,

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.830
I'll head out soon enough.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:18.210
Looks like things are developing
faster than I expected.
{\an8}but he's righted his boat
and is chasing after them!

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:18.550
{\an8}But there is now a considerable
gap between them!

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:21.510
Make sure you get that
thirty million back for me.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.719
{\an8}Number 2, Yamazaki, crosses the goal first!

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:24.090
{\an8}Number 5, Mifune, crosses next.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.429
Don't be ridiculous.

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:27.969
This wasn't your average
anonymous message board.
{\an8}Number 1, Masaki, crosses next,
followed by Number 3, Kawano.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.010
{\an8}Following them is Number 4, Nomiya,
and last is Number 6, Funegi.
- There are posting fees, handling fees, and—

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:30.650
- Signal's dropping.

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:32.100
Hey!

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:35.060
That bastard.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.290
Are the unknowns remnants of Q?

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:51.199
This will be a little troublesome if they've
been sent by the Star Religious Group.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.330
That uniform...

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.880
As soon as he saw the Jujutsu High
uniform, he anticipated a fight against

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.470
multiple opponents and set
shikigami in front of and behind him.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:08.930
He's experienced.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.220
No catalyst?!

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.640
Their cursed energy is different
from the sorcerer's, too.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.980
It couldn't be...

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.730
Curse Manipulation?!

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.310
Correct.

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.110
Living a long life has its perks, I see.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:25.280
Nah, it's not worth
living too long, you know.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.570
It costs money just to stay alive.

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:31.330
His cursed technique is stronger than mine.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.790
However, he thinks like
a typical shikigami user.

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:37.080
Add his youth on top of that,

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.540
and I can tell exactly what he's thinking.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.300
I knew it.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.090
Types like him never
step forward themselves.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.970
Close combat is his weakness!

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:53.520
Plus, he thinks a shikigami user
like me would never get close to him.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.100
He's someone who hates close
combat, and he isn't wary of it.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.980
No one is easier to kill.

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:03.440
Looks like you're thinking up lots of plans,

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.030
but there's no point.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.870
What?!

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:13.620
Those first two were to prevent
me from anticipating this?!

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.130
Now, that leaves one more.

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:26.760
You're mine!

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.490
Tasuke? Is that you, Tasuke?

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.660
My parents used all their time and money
on my well-behaved little brother.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.370
They thought I was creepy
because I could see the unseen.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:37:01.000
But Tasuke was my one and only friend,
who interacted with me without such fear.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.340
It's been a long time.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.220
Has it been over 50 years already?

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:11.010
Since the day you died—

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.300
I see now!

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.940
My life flashed before my eyes!

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:23.610
You lured me in!

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.860
Well, yeah.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.130
You were itching to get in
close that whole time, right?

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.070
Those with a set means of victory

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.110
will easily jump on the chance
when you give them that opening.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:38.100
More importantly, are you with Q?

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.580
Or the Star Religious Group?

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.230
Amanai!

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.400
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wha...

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.990
What?!

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:15.740
Riko, you have a boyfriend?!

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.620
No! He's a cousin! Just a cousin!

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.250
You're a smooth operator.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.080
I told you, he's not!

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.420
A high schooler?! He's so tall!

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.920
Hey, mister!

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.420
Take off your sunglasses!

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.940
Squee! He's so hot!

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:32.470
Such long lashes!

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:33.340
Hey.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.970
Why are your eyes blue?

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:37.180
Could you pose for me?

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.640
Hey! Quit getting carried away!

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.850
All right, everyone! Quiet down!

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:43.600
This is disgraceful!

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.980
You know you're curious
about him, too, Sensei!

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.310
Yeah.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.110
This is inappropriate.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.400
Even if you are a relative,
you can't just barge in.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.360
Oh, you'll have to forgive me.
It was an emergency.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.530
Also, here. My phone number.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:00.140
Hey! That's against the rules!

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:00.890
GRAAAH

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.590
Shut up! You don't get many chances
to meet people as a teacher!

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.790
The same is true for us, too!

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.210
I can't believe you're into younger men!
I've lost respect for you!

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.760
What?! You dissin' Hikaru Genji?!

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.690
What a lively school.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:16.980
You idiot! I told you not to show
yourself before my friends!

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.430
Curse users attacked. Figure out the rest.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:23.100
I'm floating?!

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:30.160
We're heading to Jujutsu High now.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.930
You don't want you friends to
get caught up in this, do you?

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.240
Is that the thirty million?

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.200
The one with her is another sorcerer?

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.010
Her bodyguard, too, I bet.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.870
What a sweet deal.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:45.710
Thirty million for killing a kid
who's not even a sorcerer.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:47.500
Maybe I'll have eel tonight?

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.710
Food always tastes best
after killing someone.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.170
Are you from the Star Religious Group?

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:56.820
The people in Q wore even weirder outfits.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:58.550
Are you a rookie?

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.680
If you're killing someone, do it without talking.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:06.020
Too slow.

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.620
Don't you dare take anything from that girl.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:23.830
I'll kill you.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.130
What's this?

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.710
Well, aren't you strong?

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:35.130
Where's Riko-chan?

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.510
She left the school with Gojo-sama.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.180
Then we should head that way, too.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.590
This has gotten a bit troublesome.

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:47.640
So that really was the thirty million earlier.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.060
A shikigami?!

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.520
No, it's not quite the same as a shikigami.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.940
Satoru.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.150
There's a bounty of thirty
million on Amanai's head?

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:03.120
Yeah. It was posted on an
underground site for curse users.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.830
Apparently, the time limit is
11 AM the day after tomorrow.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.830
Now things make sense.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.580
Two, three, four... They all look the same.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.880
Are they shikigami?

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:18.550
Jeez... And jujutsu sorcerers are
short-handed all year round.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:21.570
If you want to change jobs,
we'll welcome you, old man.

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:24.890
Nah, public employment
ain't easy work, either.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:27.520
Just hand over that brat and we'll be fine.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.070
There's more! Five of them now!

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:32.350
What's so great about this brat?

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.090
What did you just do?

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:44.910
The shikigami isn't disappearing!

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:46.620
Which is the real one?!

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.890
They're not shikigami.

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:49.200
They're clones.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.460
And each one is the real one.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:57.670
The hell is this?!

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:58.590
Infinity.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.300
It's Achilles and the Tortoise.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.130
Huh?!

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:03.640
It's important to study, you know.

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.140
Yours is a cloning technique that allows
a maximum of five, including the original.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.020
And you're always free to decide which
of the clones is the main body, right?

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.230
So if your main body is in danger,

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.690
you make a safe clone the main body.

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.650
That's a nice technique you have there.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:22.570
I don't understand why you're so weak.

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:27.050
Are you unable to produce a clone
for a while after it's destroyed?

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.540
How do you know what my technique is?

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.120
Unfortunately for you,

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.870
I have good eyes.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.540
You see, my technique

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:38.630
is like a convergent
series of infinite numbers.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:41.490
Anything that approaches me
grows slower and slower,

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:44.470
and ultimately, it fails to ever reach me.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.510
When I amplify my Limitless technique,

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.270
I get what you might call
a negative natural number.

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:53.850
It basically creates a
single imaginary apple.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.480
Doing so causes everything around to
get sucked into that space, like you saw.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.480
Though it's surprisingly inconvenient.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:03.650
I can't create too large
a reaction near myself,

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.950
and if I start worrying
about the vectors, too,

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.910
controlling the cursed
energy becomes a real pain.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.680
Basically, it's super exhausting.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:19.130
But that's all just the proper
operation of the technique.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.800
Protect your head.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.860
This next one is the divergence of infinity.

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:45.960
My reverse cursed technique,

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:48.450
Red!

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.260
I failed!

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:18.140
I really thought I could do it that time.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.150
Is this guy for real?

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:25.490
It's from Kuroi.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.020
Wh-What do we do?!

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.610
Kuroi has...

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.530
Kuroi has been...

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.390
There's always a chance
the worst could happen.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.520
You're much faster than me,

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.520
so go on ahead! Hurry to Riko's side!

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:49.320
I'm sorry. This was my mistake.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.580
Really?

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.980
I don't think this even counts as a mistake.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.570
I underestimated how much our
enemies would value Kuroi-san.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:58.360
Their next move

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.080
will probably be offering to
arrange an exchange for her.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.800
Something like trading Amanai for Kuroi-san,

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.930
or saying they'll kill Kuroi-san
if we don't kill Amanai.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:11.510
But we have the leverage in any
negotiations since we have Amanai.

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.420
As long as they set up
the location for the deal,

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.580
we can make it work out.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.940
I'm taking Amanai back to Jujutsu High now.

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.010
We can have Shoko or someone
stand in as her body double.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:23.030
{\an8}H-Hold on!

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.140
I'm going to this deal, too!

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.970
I still can't trust you two yet!

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:30.690
Huh?! You're still saying
that after all this, you—

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:32.350
Even if you do manage to save her...

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.590
What if Kuroi isn't back before
I assimilate with Tengen-sama?

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:39.570
I haven't...

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.010
I haven't even said goodbye to her!

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:59.040
The kidnapper will reach
out to us eventually.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.760
If they seem like they're
smarter than we expect,

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:07.350
and bringing you with us is likely to
hurt Kuroi-san's chance of survival...

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.290
then we will leave you behind.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.030
All right. That works.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.840
In exchange,

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:30.490
if you get scared partway through and
want to go home, we'll just ignore you.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.880
Bear that in mind.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.250
Mensore!

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.790
OKINAWA

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:52.290
PROTECTION MISSION DAY 2

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.230
I can't believe I got captured
by the Star Religious Group,

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:02.260
and by a non-sorcerer at that.

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:04.750
I'm ashamed of myself.

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:07.380
You couldn't help it if they
caught you off-guard.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.260
Part of the blame lies with me, too.

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:13.010
Was I really caught off-guard?

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:18.610
I thought I was on high alert
after the incident with Q.

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:20.910
Kuroi!

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:26.110
I still don't have much
recollection of being attacked.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.180
And you all came here by plane?

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.740
Were you okay?

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.240
You weren't attacked?

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:34.330
Satoru has good eyes.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.750
Before we took off, he checked over
all the passengers and staff,

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.400
as well as the inside
and outside of the plane.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.920
And while we were in the air, I had
my cursed spirit keep watch outside.

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.450
It was safer than using a land route.

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:54.670
I'm more curious as to why

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:57.940
they designated Okinawa for the exchange.

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:00.440
Probably to buy time, right?

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:00.990
TRAVEL SCHEDULE

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:02.900
Even if they fail to kill Riko-sama,

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.470
they could keep her from making
tomorrow's full moon deadline.

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:07.000
If that were the goal,
ASSIMILATE WITH TENGEN-SAMA
AFTER SUNSET!
PROTECTION MISSION FINISHED

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.410
they would choose a rural area
with poor transit infrastructure.

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:13.880
You don't think they're planning
to take over the airport, do you?

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.220
Maybe so.

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:16.410
But we'll be fine.

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:19.900
We're not the only ones who came here.

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:23.130
Clearly this isn't a mission
fit for a first-year.

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:26.090
JUJUTSU HIGH
FIRST YEAR
NANAMI KENTO

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:28.310
I'm psyched, though!
JUJUTSU HIGH
FIRST YEAR
HAIBARA YU

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:30.930
I want to show off in front of Geto-san, too!

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:34.540
Besides, I hear our upperclassmen
are wearing themselves to the bone

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.450
to protect an innocent young girl!

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:39.400
So we have to give it our all, too!

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:43.730
If a typhoon rolls in and shuts down the
airports, our efforts will be for naught.

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:46.170
UPPERCLASSMAN WEARING HIMSELF TO THE BONE

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:47.650
Sea cucumber, sea cucumber!

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:50.620
Gross! That's so gross!

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:53.990
Should we really be sightseeing like this?

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:56.260
Satoru's the one who suggested it.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.140
He's probably showing consideration
for Riko-chan, in his own way.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:02.540
Though it is getting close...

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:05.620
Satoru! It's time.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.440
Oh, it's that time already?

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.050
Boo.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.300
Suguru, let's head back
tomorrow morning instead.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:19.940
But...

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.190
The weather's holding steady, right?

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:24.320
Besides...

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:27.070
there are fewer curse users in
Okinawa than there are in Tokyo.

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.220
CURSE USERS

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.620
Let's keep it a little more serious, Satoru.

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.180
It's better if the time limit on the bounty
runs out while we're mid-flight, right?

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.100
{\an8}Young lady, a starfish.

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:36.950
{\an8}So it is!

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:38.120
Satoru.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.110
You haven't released your technique
since yesterday, have you?

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:42.690
You haven't slept, either.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:44.630
And you don't plan to sleep tonight, do you?

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:48.010
Are you sure we don't need
to go back to Jujutsu High?

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.070
It's not a problem.

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:55.800
Playing through 99 years of MomoTetsu
was far more draining.

00:49:57.390 --> 00:50:00.140
Besides, you're here, too.

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:09.600
Nanami, they said they're
extending their stay another day!

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.190
You think something happened?!

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:00.260
TOKYO JUJUTSU HIGH, FOOTHILLS OF MT. MUSHIRO

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.570
PROTECTION MISSION DAY 3 15:00

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:06.520
Good work, everyone.

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.100
We're inside Jujutsu High's barrier now.

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:14.550
What a relief.

00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:15.570
Yes.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:18.620
Satoru.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.330
You really worked hard this time.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:28.910
I never wanna get stuck
babysitting a brat again.

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:29.760
Huh?

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:39.870
Impossible!

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:44.560
We're inside Jujutsu High's barrier!

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.300
Have we met before?

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.650
Don't worry about it.

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:54.320
I'm terrible at remembering guys' names, too.

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:03.530
I once went to see the brat born into
the Gojo clan with the Six Eyes on a lark.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.180
Never before or after that

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:29.440
had anyone noticed me standing behind them.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.580
That is why I wore him down...

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.370
until his senses dulled.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:50.580
Satoru!

00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:53.810
I'm fine.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:57.010
I didn't make it in time with my
technique, but it missed my vitals.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.420
I then strengthened myself
with cursed energy

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.570
so the blade couldn't be drawn out at all.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:06.240
It was like passing a safety
pin through a knit sweater.

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.400
Seriously, I'm fine.

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.150
Prioritize Amanai first.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.590
I'll deal with this guy.

00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:18.180
Suguru, you two get her to Tengen-sama.

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:20.640
Satoru...

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:27.830
Be careful!

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.160
Let's go!

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.300
Right!

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.300
Who do you think you're talking to?

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:43.690
That's different from the
blade he stabbed me with.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:46.560
And where did that
cursed spirit come from?

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:49.560
Too many unknowns, damn it!

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.160
The Star Plasma Vessel is gone.

00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:55.860
I had hoped to take you down
with that earlier attack.

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:57.060
I guess I've gotten rusty.

00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:00.580
The bounty on Amanai has already
been taken down, you idiot.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.570
Because I took it down, prideful bastard.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:06.460
When facing people
without openings like you,

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:09.960
you have to first create ups and
downs leading to several false goals.

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:14.570
I laughed when those Star Religious
Group men went to Okinawa.

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:18.500
It sucked that none of the
sorcerers around her died,

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.970
but if I hadn't set that
time limit on the bounty,

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:25.470
you wouldn't have released
your technique until the very end.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.530
That so?

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:34.360
He's fast!

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.180
And not just that.

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:39.210
I knew there was something off about him!

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.210
He has zero cursed energy!

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:44.830
He has a Heavenly Pact
gifting him physical prowess!

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:20.620
I can't imagine anyone who knows
my technique coming without a plan.

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.120
Is that cursed tool your
precious trump card?

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.840
Sorry, but I won't let it get close!

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.540
Since he has no cursed energy,
I can't read his presence.

00:56:43.540 --> 00:56:46.680
And I can't just rely on instinct.

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:49.470
There's that cursed spirit
wrapped around him.

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:52.060
I just need to follow its presence.

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.450
Even so, he's too damn fast!

00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:59.700
Cursed Technique Amplification,

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:01.860
Maximum Output...

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:08.530
Blue!

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:25.380
Now there's no cover.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.050
He can't launch surprise attacks.

00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:28.690
Did he hide in the woods?

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.180
Are those...

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.680
Fly Heads?!

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.820
Was he keeping them inside
that cursed spirit?

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.580
So you're using Fly Heads like chaff.

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:47.500
Now I can't tell where he is.

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:50.340
He's created a blind spot.

00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:51.780
I should use Blue again...

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:55.330
No, wait! He's after...

00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:56.670
Amanai!

00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:05.880
His intuition is keen enough
to sense me empty-handed.

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.830
There's no way your Six Eyes would overlook

00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:12.060
the unusual cursed energy
oozing from this cursed tool.

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:14.790
Though that finally...

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:20.860
got you to focus on defense
with your technique.

00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:56.490
The Special-Grade Cursed Tool,
Inverted Spear of Heaven.

00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:00.700
Its effect is the forced release
of any active techniques.

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:02.600
I think...

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:08.380
I'm getting my edge back now.

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.130
Riko-sama.

00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:51.620
This is as far as I go.

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.280
Riko-sama, please...

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:56.700
Please...

01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:03.910
Kuroi, I love you!

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:07.650
I always have, and I always will!

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.670
Me, too!

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.340
I love you, too!

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.480
So this is...

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.490
Yeah.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.870
We're in Tengen-sama's territory now.

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.620
This is the foundation of
the nation's key barriers,

01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:45.750
The Main Hall of the Tombs of the Star.

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:48.860
Once you descend the stairs,

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.880
pass through the gate and continue
to the base of the big tree.

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:56.530
Then you'll be inside the special
barrier that's separate from

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:58.390
the barrier surrounding Jujutsu High.

01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:01.570
Only those invited are able to enter it.

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:05.600
Tengen-sama will protect
you until the assimilation.

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:09.640
That...

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.780
or we can turn back around
and go home with Kuroi-san.

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.890
Huh?

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:21.500
When our teacher told us about this mission,

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.840
he called the assimilation "erasing."

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:29.750
He was trying to tell us to be aware
of how heavy a sin that was.

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:32.080
Our teacher may be a muscle-brain,

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.140
but he often does roundabout things.

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:42.420
Satoru and I already talked it
over before we met you.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:47.900
What if the Star Plasma Vessel
brat refuses to assimilate?

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:51.400
Then... the assimilation's off!

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:54.140
Are you sure about that?

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:54.900
Huh?

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.910
It might mean fighting
Tengen-sama, you know.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.420
You scared?

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.580
It's fine. It'll all work out somehow.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:09.180
We are the strongest.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.150
No matter what decision you make,

01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:14.760
we will guarantee your future.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.100
I have...

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:23.270
always been special,
since the day I was born.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.550
Everyone kept telling me
that I was different.

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.730
Being special was normal to me,

01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:33.210
and I've lived my life trying
to avoid danger

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:35.320
as much as possible
for the sake of this day.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:40.710
I don't really remember the
day my mother and father died.

01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:43.450
I no longer feel sad or lonely about that.

01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:46.700
I figured everything would be fine,

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:50.170
even if I was taken away
from everyone and assimilated.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.540
That no matter how hard it was,

01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:59.720
it would stop feeling sad and lonely one day.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.460
But...

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.420
But...

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:06.200
Honestly...

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.200
I want to be with everyone longer!

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.900
I want to go to all kinds
of places with everyone!

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:19.090
I want to see all kinds
of things and do more!

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:22.580
Let's go home, Riko-chan.

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:30.610
Yeah!

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.780
Riko-chan?

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.250
Okay, job's done.

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:55.330
You're free to go now.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.500
Why are you here?

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.850
Why?

01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:08.900
Oh, that's what you mean.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:14.420
Because I killed Gojo Satoru.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.330
Is that so?

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:31.410
Die!

01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:07.890
Don't be so impatient.

01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:16.110
The Tombs of the Star
and the Forbidden Vault

01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:17.700
use barriers that conceal.

01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:20.200
So they can't place guards at the entrances.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.580
As long as you know where the doors are,

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.160
they're full of holes.

01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:28.410
Sorcerers are busy during this time of year,

01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:31.830
and Jujutsu High is brimming
with Fly Heads right now.

01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:34.300
It's pure chaos outside.

01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:38.220
And since I have no cursed energy,
I'm like the invisible man.

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:41.180
There was one problem, though.

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:43.180
If I wield a cursed tool,

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:47.270
the cursed energy from it will stop
me from being an invisible man.

01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:56.610
Now, there's more to this story.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.950
See, I keep a cursed spirit
capable of storing objects around.

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:04.620
So I usually put my cursed tools
in it when I'm walking around.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.700
You don't have to say it.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.410
Yes, that means the cursed energy from

01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:12.250
the cursed spirit should stop me
from being an invisible man.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.420
So I make the cursed spirit smaller,
until it can fit inside my body.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.550
Then I keep it inside my stomach.

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:26.640
After all, the organs of the invisible
man are invisible, too, right?

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.640
That's how I'm able to
pass through any barrier

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.100
while still carrying
all kinds of cursed tools.

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:39.940
That's also why I didn't use
a cursed tool at first.

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.820
A surprise attack on the Six Eyes

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:46.410
would be pointless if I wasn't invisible.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:50.000
I could've killed the Star Plasma Vessel first,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.540
but the risk of the Six Eyes seeing me was too—

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.460
Enough.

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:55.250
You have a Heavenly Pact, right?

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:56.960
I know revealing information about

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.420
your ability increases its fundamental
strength, just like for a sorcerer.

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.930
That's not what I want to know.

01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:07.470
How did you know which doors
led to the Tombs of the Star?

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:11.180
We didn't leave even
the slightest residuals.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:14.870
Humans leave plenty of
traces aside from residuals.

01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:17.320
Like scents, footprints, and so on.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.780
My pact enhances all five of my senses, too.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:22.860
There should have been
another woman on the way here.

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:24.240
What happened to her?

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.240
Hm?

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:28.080
Oh, that maid?

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.620
She's probably dead.

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.950
I didn't care if she lived or died, though.

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:33.660
If she's lucky, she might still be alive.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.580
Is that so?

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:38.460
You really should... die!

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:21.899
That Rainbow Dragon has
the toughest hide there is!

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:32.100
Curse Manipulation...

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:34.229
Riffraff.

01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:49.069
Hey, am...

01:08:49.069 --> 01:08:51.830
Am... Am I...

01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:53.410
pretty?

01:08:54.649 --> 01:08:56.250
A potential apparition?

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:58.040
It deploys a simple domain that

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.760
enforces non-violence on both of us
until I answer its question, then?

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:04.590
Ah, well...

01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:06.420
Then I'll just come out and say

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:07.689
you're not my type.

01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:15.180
So that's how it is.

01:09:20.899 --> 01:09:22.149
Idiot.

01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:24.359
It's over.

01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:26.109
For you!

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.370
Curse Manipulation.

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:33.950
It's a technique that lets me
absorb cursed spirits

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:36.370
that have surrendered,
and freely manipulate them.

01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:39.330
If there's roughly a two-grade
difference in our levels,

01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:40.750
I skip making them submit

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:42.920
and absorb them unconditionally.

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:47.779
His cursed spirit may have a unique ability,
but it's not that strong itself.

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.930
I can absorb it. That'll lock down his armory.

01:09:51.930 --> 01:09:53.800
Then I can just brute-force him—

01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:24.460
I didn't cut you badly enough to kill you.

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:27.000
I would've killed you if
you were a shikigami user,

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.380
but since it's Curse Manipulation,

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:33.810
there's no telling what might happen to the
cursed spirits you've absorbed after you die.

01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:37.780
I'd rather avoid extra trouble here.

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:40.020
You have the blessing of parentage.

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:43.770
But even with that blessing,

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:48.320
you were all beaten by a monkey like me
who can't even use cursed techniques.

01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:51.570
If you want to live a long life,
never forget that.

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:58.040
Oh, speaking of blessings...

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.000
That's right. I almost forgot.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.210
I named him Megumi.

01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:06.230
STAR RELIGIOUS GROUP HEADQUARTERS
HOUSE OF THE CHILDREN OF THE STAR

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:21.120
Go on, now.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.670
The corpse of the Star Plasma
Vessel, Riko Amanai.

01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:30.290
All four limbs intact, too.

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:36.340
Hmm, indeed.

01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:38.570
We'll issue your payment as we discussed.

01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:40.680
Star
Religious Group
Representative
Shigeru
Sonoda

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:42.600
I'll even throw in a bonus.

01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:44.770
Thank you, Founder.

01:11:44.770 --> 01:11:46.100
You're so generous.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.190
He's not the founder.

01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:49.190
Huh?

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.810
Do you mean it?

01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:55.570
I know it was a necessary expense,
but you've already helped us out a lot, too.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.240
I thought you'd complain a bit more.

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:03.530
We hired you for the assassination
expecting that it would fail.

01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:05.490
Our Star Religious Group
was founded in the Nara Era,

01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:08.710
when Tengen-sama began preaching

01:12:08.710 --> 01:12:11.080
about the moral foundation
of jujutsu sorcerers,

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.660
a minority, as Buddhism
spread throughout Japan.

01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:17.800
Jujutsu society and religious corporations
are at complete odds with each other.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.050
That strain is what gave birth

01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:24.390
to our modern Star Religious Group,
the Time Vessel Association.

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:27.810
That is also why we have devoted
ourselves to remaining non-sorcerers.

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:31.650
Jujutsu sorcerers are granted
many privileges above the law,

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:34.570
but they're still fundamentally forbidden
to lay a hand on non-sorcerers.

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:37.610
However, the time had finally arrived.

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:41.860
The time of the taboo
recorded in our scriptures!

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.950
Our Star Religious Group has evolved to

01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:46.160
a monotheistic religion
worshiping one absolute god!

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.210
And it was now time for our object of
worship to assimilate with that impurity!

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.090
If our believers saw us simply sit back
and watch the assimilation happen,

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:56.840
our Association would crumble.

01:12:57.550 --> 01:13:02.090
Yet if we took excessive action,
jujutsu sorcerers would crush us.

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.850
So we were truly desperate.

01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:08.060
And how did it all turn out?

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:10.480
We thought we were going to lose everything,

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.600
and now we have it all!

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:16.070
Of course that would
loosen our purse strings.

01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:23.610
Human society might be what crumbles
if Tengen-sama loses control, though.

01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:29.200
If we should perish along with our star,
then that is all there is to it.

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:44.260
Were you referring to Okinawa
when you said they helped us?

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:45.130
Yeah.

01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:48.680
Why didn't you kill the maid then?

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.090
I know I told you,

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.810
"Take her someplace far away,
and kill her at some point."

01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:58.570
Because I had a good idea of what
you were planning at the time.

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:01.640
I made the call that the relief
from the maid's successful rescue

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:05.490
would wear him down more than
heightened tensions from failure.

01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:11.440
You often ignore the lines of communication
and toss out whatever I was planning, right?

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.080
It all worked out in the end.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.330
And stop running your mediator ragged.

01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:20.090
Yeah, but why Okinawa?

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.380
I had a laugh at that myself.

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:27.550
Normally, you'd use a car
to transport a captive, right?

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:30.760
Public transportation carries
too many risks, after all.

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:35.310
But get this. The president
owned his own private jet.

01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:38.190
Even so...

01:14:40.190 --> 01:14:43.150
Rich people think on a different scale, man.

01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:45.490
Well, let's go eat with their money.

01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:48.120
Take me to one of the
restaurants you use for clients.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.120
No way.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.120
You never pay for a guy, anyway.

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:55.910
I've already decided I'll only see you

01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:59.130
either for work or in Hell.

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:17.350
Huh?

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:23.150
Hey, it's been a while.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.650
For real?

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:27.610
For real, real.

01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:30.870
I'm alive and kicking!

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.060
Reverse cursed technique!

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.330
Bingo!

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:37.930
When you stabbed me through the throat,

01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:39.460
I gave up on counterattacking

01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:42.290
and poured all my focus into
the reverse cursed technique.

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.960
Cursed energy is negative energy.

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.180
While it can enhance the body,
it can't regenerate it.

01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:52.760
So you multiply that negative energy
against itself to create positive energy.

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.520
That's the reverse cursed technique.

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.350
Easier said than done!

01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:58.720
I hadn't been able to do
that up until now myself!

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.560
And I couldn't understand anything
the one person who could do it said!

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.310
{\an8}He's blabbing on and on...

01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:06.030
He's high.

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:08.980
But I finally grasped it
on the verge of death!

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:10.980
The true essence of cursed energy!

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:14.580
The reason you're going to lose is
because you didn't chop my head off,

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:18.250
and because you didn't use that cursed
tool when you stabbed my head.

01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:20.250
I'm going to lose?

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.040
Our fight is just getting started.

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:27.460
Oh? Is it?

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:28.970
Yeah...

01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:30.760
Maybe so!

01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:45.650
Cursed Technique Reversal:

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:48.650
Red.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.410
Monster.

01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:14.260
No bones are broken.

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:18.180
That shock wave was an
application of Limitless,

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:20.220
the cursed technique reversal, Red, huh?

01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:24.690
So he poured the positive energy generated
by the reverse cursed technique

01:17:24.690 --> 01:17:29.490
into the Limitless
technique ingrained into him.

01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:32.070
One, the power to stop:

01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:34.240
the neutral application
of the Limitless technique.

01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:37.910
Two, the power to attract:

01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:40.620
the amplified application of
the Limitless technique, Blue.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:44.080
And three, the power to repel:

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.920
the reversal of his cursed technique, Red.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.830
All things I can handle.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:54.800
Something's off.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.930
Something's off.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.940
No, this is fine.

01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:10.480
I'll kill you.

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:32.970
Sorry, Amanai.

01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:36.970
I'm not even angry over you right now.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:40.180
I bear no grudge against anyone.

01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:47.200
It's just that the world feels
so, so wonderful right now.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.460
"Throughout Heaven and Earth,
I alone am the honored one."

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:14.170
The merit of having a technique
that's passed down for generations

01:19:14.170 --> 01:19:15.760
is having a user's manual.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.220
The demerit is that

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.140
information about the
technique is easily leaked.

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:24.100
You were a member of
the Zen'in clan, weren't you?

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:27.980
That's why you know so much
about the Limitless technique.

01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:32.820
However, even in the Gojo clan,

01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:35.110
only a scant few know about this.

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:48.210
Take the amplified and the reversal,

01:19:48.210 --> 01:19:51.040
then smash together those
two different expressions

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.710
of infinity to create and
push out imaginary mass.

01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:56.470
Imaginary Technique: Purple.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.060
Something's off.

01:20:08.690 --> 01:20:10.980
"I refuse to do any work for free."

01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:14.610
Normally I would've said that
and hightailed it out of there.

01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:20.320
Yet the freshly awakened wielder of the
Limitless technique was right before my eyes.

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.950
He was probably the strongest jujutsu
sorcerer of the modern age.

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.700
I wanted to reject him.

01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:28.790
I wanted to bring him to his knees.

01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:32.540
I wanted to take down the
pinnacle of the jujutsu world

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.170
and the Zen'in clan that rejected me.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:40.130
I twisted myself to try to affirm myself.

01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:44.180
That was the moment I lost.

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:56.190
I thought you had abandoned that pride.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:03.780
I thought you had chosen to live without
respecting yourself or anyone else.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.700
Any last words?

01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:15.170
Nah.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.770
Two or three years from now,

01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:31.440
my kid will be sold off to the Zen'in clan.

01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:34.100
Do what you will with that.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.770
Mommy!

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:08.140
Hug me!

01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:48.930
You're late, Suguru.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.600
No, I guess you got here fast.

01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:55.890
There are several Star Religious
Group facilities in the city, after all.

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.860
Satoru? Is that you?

01:23:00.670 --> 01:23:02.320
What happened?

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.990
I see you already saw Shoko.

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.410
Yeah, she healed me.

01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:09.370
I'm fine now.

01:23:12.450 --> 01:23:15.880
No, me being safe doesn't
help anything here.

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.800
I screwed up.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.250
You're not at fault.

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.380
Let's head back.

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:25.510
Suguru, should we kill these guys?

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:29.220
The way I feel right now,
I doubt I'd feel anything about it.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.190
No. There's no point.

01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:38.560
It looks like there are only
common believers here.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.450
The masterminds who know about our
world have probably fled already.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.280
And unlike with the bounty,

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.990
they won't be able to
talk their way out of this.

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:50.410
The organization had
problems to begin with.

01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:52.380
It'll be dissolved soon enough.

01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:55.670
No point, huh?

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:59.170
Does there really need
to be any point to it?

01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:12.680
It's very important that there is.

01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:16.310
Especially for a jujutsu sorcerer.

01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:21.330
1 YEAR LATER
AUGUST 2007

01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:24.320
Here we go.

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.950
Yeah, it's working.

01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:33.780
Ugh, what the heck was that?

01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:36.410
Automatic selection of targets
for your jujutsu technique?

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:37.410
Yup.

01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:40.550
Though, to be precise,
I'm the target for the technique.

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:44.130
I've automated what I used to do manually.

01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:45.920
Now it can discern an object's danger level

01:24:46.210 --> 01:24:50.800
based on the strength of its cursed energy,
its mass, its velocity, and its shape.

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.990
I'd like to get it to discern poisons, too,

01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:55.970
but that's still proving difficult.

01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:58.610
This will allow me to keep
my Limitless technique active

01:24:58.610 --> 01:25:01.110
almost perpetually with minimal resources.

01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:04.070
Having it perpetually active
will fry your brain.

01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:06.510
But I can also keep running
the reverse cursed technique

01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:08.160
with the energy I generate on my own.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.700
So I'm constantly giving it
a fresh brain to work with.

01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:14.250
I'd already been working on shortening
my hand seals. That's nailed now, too.

01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:19.500
So I can also activate multiple
instances of Blue and Red simultaneously.

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:20.920
The only remaining hurdles are

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:23.670
Domain Expansion and
teleportation over long distances.

01:25:24.170 --> 01:25:26.330
I should be able to get
that down if we set up

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:29.170
some courses without any
obstacles in Jujutsu High.

01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:32.460
Shoko, could you lend me some lab rats?

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.730
Uh...

01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:36.030
Satoru had become the "strongest."

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:38.700
Suguru, have you lost weight?

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.780
You okay?

01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:43.140
He handled all of his missions alone,

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:46.770
and Shoko was never sent out on
dangerous missions in the first place,

01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:50.630
which naturally meant I was sent
on missions alone more often, too.

01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:52.830
It's just heat fatigue.

01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:54.300
I'll be fine.

01:25:55.050 --> 01:25:56.790
Did you eat too much somen?

01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:00.730
Things were busy that summer.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:05.050
Episode 29
Premature Death

01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:09.340
Likely spurred by the frequent
disasters of the past year,

01:26:10.050 --> 01:26:12.430
cursed spirits were
springing up like maggots.

01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:16.170
Exorcise, absorb.

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:17.550
Over and over.

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:19.040
Exorcise.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.010
Absorb.

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:23.930
No one else understands
what cursed spirits taste like.

01:26:24.370 --> 01:26:27.770
It's like swallowing a dirty rag that's
been used to clean up shit and vomit.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.910
Who am I doing this for?

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.090
Exorcise.

01:26:37.090 --> 01:26:37.910
Absorb.

01:26:38.890 --> 01:26:42.260
Ever since that day,
I've been telling myself,

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:45.010
"What I witnessed isn't uncommon."

01:26:45.010 --> 01:26:48.940
"I understood the ugliness of the masses,

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:53.340
"and still chose to be a
jujutsu sorcerer to save others."

01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:03.900
"Don't waver."

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.850
"Fulfill your duty as a
strong jujutsu sorcerer."

01:27:26.410 --> 01:27:27.880
Damn monkeys...

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:32.580
Geto-san!

01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.260
Haibara...

01:27:36.170 --> 01:27:37.690
Good work out there!

01:27:38.130 --> 01:27:39.510
Want something to drink?

01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:42.070
Huh? No, I'd feel bad!

01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:43.050
But I'll take a cola!

01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:49.150
I'm going pretty far away
for my mission tomorrow.

01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:50.330
That so?

01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:51.770
Bring back souvenirs.

01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:52.980
Of course!

01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:56.020
Do you prefer sweet stuff or salty stuff?

01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.660
Satoru might eat some, too, so... sweet, I guess?

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.250
Got it!

01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:07.230
Haibara...

01:28:07.700 --> 01:28:11.290
Do you think you can keep going as a
jujutsu sorcerer? It's not too hard for you?

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:14.130
Well...

01:28:15.230 --> 01:28:19.010
I'm not really one to think
about things too deeply,

01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:23.640
so it feels really good to be able to
give my all to something I can actually do.

01:28:25.570 --> 01:28:26.700
I see.

01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:28.700
Yeah, it does.

01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:34.940
Are you Geto-kun?

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:38.510
What kind of woman is your type?

01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:41.500
Who are you?

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.680
I like girls who eat a lot!

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:45.660
Oh?

01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:47.160
Haibara...

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.090
It's okay.

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:50.850
She's not a bad person.

01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:53.170
I'm a great judge of character!

01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:56.010
You say that while sitting next to me?

01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:58.570
Yes!

01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:02.990
He was being sarcastic, you know.

01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:05.550
Excuse me.

01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:08.150
Your underclassman?

01:29:08.150 --> 01:29:10.280
He's cute. I like how frank he is.

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.590
I think he should be more
suspicious of people as a sorcerer.

01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:17.320
So, are you not going to answer?

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.560
Please answer my question first.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.830
Who are you?

01:29:22.170 --> 01:29:24.940
Special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo.

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:26.740
That ring any bells?

01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:29.010
You're her ?

01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:31.580
Oh, I like the sound of that! What do they say?

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:35.690
That you're a special-grade
who never accepts any missions,

01:29:35.690 --> 01:29:38.970
and you're a good-for-nothing
who's been wandering around abroad.

01:29:38.970 --> 01:29:41.860
I hate Jujutsu High.

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:42.070
pouting...

01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.970
She's pouting.

01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:44.620
I'm joking.

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:48.750
Though it's true that I don't get along
with Jujutsu High's policies.

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:52.340
What they're doing is just treating symptoms,

01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:54.860
and I want to do something
to treat the cause.

01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:57.070
Treat the cause?

01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:59.370
Rather than hunt down cursed spirits,

01:29:59.370 --> 01:30:02.530
I want to create a world
where cursed spirits aren't born.

01:30:05.290 --> 01:30:07.160
Care for a little lesson?

01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:10.150
What are cursed spirits to begin with?

01:30:10.150 --> 01:30:12.980
They're creatures that take
shape when cursed energy

01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:16.290
leaking from humans
builds up like sediment.

01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:18.150
Excellent.

01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:22.550
Now this means there are two ways to create
a world where cursed spirits aren't born.

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:26.490
One: Eliminate cursed energy from mankind.

01:30:26.490 --> 01:30:30.560
Two: Make it possible for all of humanity
to control their cursed energy.

01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:34.320
I thought number one had a
pretty good chance of working.

01:30:34.710 --> 01:30:36.550
There was a model case for it, too.

01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:38.010
A model case?

01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:40.280
Someone you know well.

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.900
Toji Zen'in.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.340
I've seen plenty of cases
where a Heavenly Pact reduced

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:48.260
a person's cursed energy to the
level of your average person,

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:50.400
but you could search the
whole world only to find

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:53.050
he was the only case in which
that cursed energy dropped to zero.

01:30:54.010 --> 01:30:57.480
That wasn't the only intriguing
thing about him, either.

01:30:57.910 --> 01:31:01.160
Even though Zen'in Toji
had zero cursed energy,

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.580
he was able to perceive cursed
spirits with his five senses.

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:05.930
By completely casting aside cursed energy,

01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:07.790
his body drew a hard line

01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:10.680
and actually gave him
great resistance to curses.

01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:12.780
He truly was superhuman.

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.310
You shouldn't be ashamed of losing to him.

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:20.230
I wanted to try studying him,
but he turned me down.

01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:22.190
It was a real shame to lose him.

01:31:22.690 --> 01:31:25.160
And there aren't many people
with Heavenly Pacts,

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.850
so I'm currently favoring route number two,

01:31:27.850 --> 01:31:31.540
making it possible for all of humanity
to control their cursed energy.

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:33.540
Did you know?

01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:36.490
Cursed spirits aren't born from sorcerers.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:40.350
Of course, that excludes cases
where the jujutsu sorcerer

01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:42.140
turns themselves into a curse after death.

01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:47.290
Compared to non-sorcerers, jujutsu sorcerers
leak extremely little cursed energy.

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.760
There's some variance based
on the sorcerer's capacity

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.060
and the amount of cursed
energy their technique expends,

01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:54.660
but the main reason is their flow.

01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:59.020
Jujutsu sorcerers circulate cursed
energy through their own bodies well.

01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:00.950
To put it in rough, general terms,

01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:03.550
if all of mankind were jujutsu sorcerers,

01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:05.290
curses wouldn't be born.

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:10.790
Then you could solve it simply
by killing all non-sorcerers.

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:14.240
Geto-kun.

01:32:15.210 --> 01:32:17.120
That's possible.

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.770
Huh? But...

01:32:20.010 --> 01:32:23.800
I mean, that's probably
the easiest way to achieve it.

01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:26.580
Just keep culling non-sorcerers and

01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:30.000
force them to adapt into sorcerers
as a survival strategy.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.050
You would be forcing them to
evolve using fear and danger,

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:37.810
the same way birds gained wings.

01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:41.850
But unfortunately, I'm not
crazy enough to do that.

01:32:41.850 --> 01:32:45.070
Do you hate non-sorcerers, Geto-kun?

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:50.790
I don't know.

01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:54.770
I always thought jujutsu sorcery
existed to protect non-sorcerers.

01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:57.560
But lately, the value of non-sorcerers

01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:00.110
has been wavering in my mind.

01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:02.540
The admirability of the weak...

01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:04.460
The ugliness of the weak...

01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:07.970
I find myself struggling to discern
the difference and accept those things.

01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:10.300
There's a part of me
that despises non-sorcerers,

01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:12.390
and a part of me that wants to reject that part.

01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:14.970
My vision for what lies at
the end of the marathon game

01:33:14.970 --> 01:33:17.390
of being a jujutsu sorcerer is so vague now

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:20.130
that I can't tell which
represents how I truly feel.

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.410
Neither one is how you truly feel.

01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:29.150
You're not at that stage yet.

01:33:29.150 --> 01:33:31.650
This part of you despising non-sorcerers,

01:33:31.650 --> 01:33:33.910
and this part of you rejecting that,

01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:37.230
are both just possibilities
that you're considering.

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:39.900
It's up to you to choose which part

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:42.520
becomes your true
feelings from here on out.

01:33:46.290 --> 01:33:47.560
See you later.

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:50.680
It's a shame I didn't get to
talk to Gojo-kun, too,

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.580
but it looks like I missed him today.

01:33:53.050 --> 01:33:56.410
I hope the three of us can all
get along as fellow special-grades.

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.460
I'll pass that along to Satoru.

01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:03.700
Oh, right, one last thing.

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:06.590
You don't need to worry
about the Star Plasma Vessel.

01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:10.240
Either there was already another
Star Plasma Vessel at the time,

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.680
or a new Star Plasma Vessel
has already been born.

01:34:14.150 --> 01:34:17.590
Either way, Tengen is stable.

01:34:21.690 --> 01:34:22.960
I'm sure.

01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:26.850
Oh, I didn't get his type.

01:34:29.610 --> 01:34:34.350
It was supposed to be an easy mission to
exterminate a second-grade cursed spirit!

01:34:39.090 --> 01:34:39.970
Damn it!

01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:46.990
Their faith in Ubusunagami...

01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:51.030
That was a local deity.

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.450
That was a first-grade case!

01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:59.250
You need to rest for now, Nanami.

01:34:59.610 --> 01:35:01.700
Satoru has taken up your mission.

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:07.090
Can't we just leave everything
up to him alone at this point?

01:35:08.890 --> 01:35:11.710
This marathon game of being
a jujutsu sorcerer...

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:16.090
If the only thing waiting at the end

01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:21.270
is a mountain of our
comrades' corpses, then...

01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:34.200
What is this?

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.890
What, you ask?

01:35:35.890 --> 01:35:38.950
These two are responsible
for the latest incidents, right?

01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:42.710
No, they're not.

01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:51.380
These two are crazy!

01:35:51.730 --> 01:35:55.290
They used their mysterious powers
to attack the villagers!

01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:58.930
I've already exterminated
the cause of those incidents.

01:35:58.930 --> 01:36:02.050
My granddaughter was nearly
killed by these two, too!

01:36:02.050 --> 01:36:03.180
That's because she—

01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:05.170
Shut up, you monsters!

01:36:05.170 --> 01:36:07.220
Your parents were just as bad!

01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:07.230
{\an8}It... It's okay.

01:36:07.230 --> 01:36:10.610
I knew we should have killed you
two when you were babies!

01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:15.320
This part of you despising non-sorcerers,

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.940
and this part of you rejecting that..

01:36:17.370 --> 01:36:19.660
It's up to you to choose which part...

01:36:20.250 --> 01:36:24.120
Everyone, shall we step
outside for a moment?

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.620
...becomes your true
feelings from here on out.

01:36:32.010 --> 01:36:33.410
What?!

01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:34.540
Why?!

01:36:37.050 --> 01:36:38.400
No!

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.690
112 RESIDENTS OF THE VILLAGE WERE KILLED,
AFTER WHICH A FIRE...
BY THE TIME JUJUTSU HIGH INVESTIGATED
ON 23RD SEPTEMBER

01:36:54.690 --> 01:36:57.070
INVESTIGATIONS CONFIRMED THAT ALL 112
WERE KILLED BY A CURSED SPIRIT, WHICH THE RESIDUALS REVEALED TO BE THE WORK
OF SUGURU GETO'S CURSED MANIUPLATION

01:36:57.070 --> 01:37:00.450
...SENTENCED TO DEATH.

01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:06.650
Huh?

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:09.580
Don't make me repeat myself.

01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:11.660
Suguru killed everyone in the village and—

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:13.510
I heard you the first time.

01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:15.880
That's why I said, "Huh?"

01:37:17.230 --> 01:37:20.770
Suguru's old home was already
an empty husk, as well.

01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:24.970
Though, from the bloodstains and residuals, he most likely killed his parents, too—

01:37:24.970 --> 01:37:26.130
Like hell he did!

01:37:26.130 --> 01:37:27.480
Satoru.

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:30.980
I don't understand what's going on, either.

01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:40.860
HUH? A HIGH SCHOOLER?

01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:46.390
Need a light?

01:37:48.330 --> 01:37:49.280
Hey.

01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:51.790
It's the criminal.

01:37:52.130 --> 01:37:53.540
Need something?

01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:55.840
Just testing my luck, I guess.

01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:58.730
I'll go ahead and ask...

01:37:58.730 --> 01:38:00.380
Any chance the charges are false?

01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:02.850
Nope. Unfortunately not.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:06.290
I'll ask further, then. Why?

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.840
I'm going to create a world
of only jujutsu sorcerers.

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.980
I don't get it.

01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:13.820
I'm not a child.

01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:17.200
I'm not holding out hope
that everyone will understand.

01:38:17.610 --> 01:38:20.880
Sulking over the idea that
no one will understand you

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:23.370
sounds pretty childish to me, though.

01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:24.980
Hey, Gojo?

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.540
I found Geto.

01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:28.660
Yeah, Shinjuku.

01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:32.120
No way. I don't want to get killed.

01:38:41.410 --> 01:38:43.840
Explain yourself, Suguru.

01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:50.170
You already heard from Shoko, right?

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.810
That's all there is to it.

01:38:52.810 --> 01:38:55.310
So you're just going to kill
everyone who's not a sorcerer?

01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:57.320
Even your parents?!

01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:00.370
I can't allow my parents
to be a special exception.

01:39:00.370 --> 01:39:03.570
Besides, those people
aren't my family anymore.

01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:05.440
That's not what I was asking!

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:08.620
I thought we weren't allowed to
kill when there's no point to it!

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.770
There is a point to it. Significance, too.

01:39:11.770 --> 01:39:13.160
Even a great cause.

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.650
There's not!

01:39:14.650 --> 01:39:18.230
You're going to kill all non-sorcerers and
create a world of only jujutsu sorcerers?!

01:39:18.230 --> 01:39:19.670
You know that's impossible!

01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:22.420
There's no point in chipping away bit by bit

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:24.180
at something you can't possibly do!

01:39:25.870 --> 01:39:27.180
How arrogant.

01:39:28.150 --> 01:39:29.310
Huh?

01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:32.650
You could do it, couldn't you, Satoru?

01:39:35.410 --> 01:39:37.480
Yet you would try to convince someone else

01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:42.400
that it's impossible to do
something that's possible for you?

01:39:45.610 --> 01:39:49.130
Are you the strongest
because you're Satoru Gojo?

01:39:49.130 --> 01:39:51.690
Or does being the strongest
make you Satoru Gojo?

01:39:51.690 --> 01:39:53.820
What are you trying to say?

01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:56.570
If I were able to become you,

01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.620
this foolish ideal would become a lot
more grounded and real, don't you think?

01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:04.250
I've decided how I'll live my life.

01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:07.130
Now it's just a matter of doing
the best I can to achieve that.

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.340
If you want to kill me, then kill me.

01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:22.100
There would be a point to that.

01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.170
Why didn't you pursue him?

01:40:47.610 --> 01:40:50.010
You're actually asking me that?

01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:53.550
Nah, it's fine.

01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:55.130
My bad.

01:40:58.890 --> 01:41:01.500
Sensei, I'm strong, right?

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:04.290
Yeah, brazenly so.

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.710
But apparently, it's not good enough
for just me to be strong.

01:41:10.350 --> 01:41:12.210
The only ones I can save

01:41:12.210 --> 01:41:14.940
are those who are already ready
to be saved by another.

01:41:19.770 --> 01:41:22.570
I thought the Star Religious Group
was already dissolved.

01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:25.400
It's a different group,
but their roots are the same.

01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:28.290
They're claiming they just bought
the existing space as-is.

01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:29.370
Don't like it?

01:41:29.370 --> 01:41:33.170
No, it doesn't matter, as long as
I can gather curses and money.

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:35.970
Are you really going out dressed like that?

01:41:35.970 --> 01:41:38.860
Why not? A little showmanship is important.

01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:40.870
Geto-sama...

01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:42.250
Watch closely.

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.930
They're all there, right?

01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:47.180
All the branch directors,
all the representatives, and the president.

01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:49.460
All the big donors, as well.

01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:57.890
Test, test. Sorry for the wait, everyone.

01:41:57.890 --> 01:41:59.770
Now, I'll keep this brief.

01:42:00.130 --> 01:42:03.770
From this moment onward,
this organization belongs to me.

01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:05.860
I'll be changing the name, too,

01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:08.650
so everyone, please be sure to follow me.

01:42:08.650 --> 01:42:10.530
MANY OBJECTED

01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:12.730
Now, that's not good.

01:42:13.290 --> 01:42:14.670
I know!

01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:17.650
Sonoda-san, if you wouldn't mind,
please come to the stage.

01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:20.410
Yes! You there!

01:42:21.090 --> 01:42:23.080
Now, once again.

01:42:23.610 --> 01:42:25.090
I hate monkeys.

01:42:25.090 --> 01:42:27.030
You obey me now...

01:42:27.250 --> 01:42:29.520
That's the true feeling I chose.

01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:31.570
...monkeys.

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:37.020
You're Megumi Fushiguro-kun, right?

01:42:39.150 --> 01:42:40.570
Who are you?

01:42:40.570 --> 01:42:42.860
And what's with that weird face?

01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:46.790
You look just like him, is all.

01:42:48.150 --> 01:42:49.690
My own issue.

01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:51.970
So listen. About your dad...

01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:55.040
He's from this big shot jujutsu
sorcerer family called the Zen'in,

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:57.210
but they're such scumbags
they make even me sick,

01:42:57.210 --> 01:43:00.290
and that's why your dad left
the family and had you.

01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:02.830
Now, you're one of the
ones who can see things,

01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:04.330
so you're privileged there, right?

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:07.580
You've noticed the power
within yourself, too, yeah?

01:43:08.130 --> 01:43:10.770
The Zen'in clan just loves strong powers.

01:43:10.770 --> 01:43:13.970
Most become aware of their cursed
techniques around 4-6 years old.

01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:16.440
So it's the perfect timing to sell a kid off.

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:18.350
So, Megumi-kun,

01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:22.690
you were the ultimate card that your dad
kept on hand against the Zen'in clan.

01:43:22.690 --> 01:43:24.390
Pisses you off, doesn't it?

01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:27.280
So, about that dad of yours. I ki—

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:28.280
I don't care.

01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:31.650
I have no interest in where
he is or what he's doing.

01:43:31.650 --> 01:43:34.540
I haven't even seen him in years,
so I don't remember what he looks like.

01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:37.160
Though I get the general idea
from what you just said.

01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:40.990
Tsumiki's mother hasn't come home
for a while now, either.

01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:43.350
Ah, Megumi's home!

01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:46.090
That means they're finished with us,

01:43:46.090 --> 01:43:48.590
and they're off enjoying
themselves elsewhere, right?

01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:52.580
Are you really a first grader?

01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:54.490
Well, whatever.

01:43:54.490 --> 01:43:57.610
If you ever want to know about
your father, you can ask me.

01:43:57.610 --> 01:43:59.420
Hup.

01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:01.890
I think it'll be pretty interesting to hear.

01:44:01.890 --> 01:44:03.610
Now, on to the main point.

01:44:03.610 --> 01:44:05.280
What do you want to do?

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.970
Do you want to go to the Zen'in clan?

01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:09.450
What will happen to Tsumiki?

01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:13.530
If I go there, will Tsumiki be able to
find happiness? It all depends on that.

01:44:13.530 --> 01:44:15.810
No. A hundred percent no.

01:44:15.810 --> 01:44:17.630
I can say that with certainty.

01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:22.490
Okay!

01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:25.250
Leave the rest to me, then.

01:44:27.110 --> 01:44:30.370
I might need you to push yourself a bit, though.

01:44:30.690 --> 01:44:32.050
So do your best.

01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:34.070
Get stronger.

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:37.480
Strong enough to keep up with me.

01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:42.800
OCTOBER 19, 2018

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:45.520
Gojo-sensei.

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:47.480
So even Sensei sleeps, huh?

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:49.990
Of course he does.
What kind of nonsense is that?

01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:51.350
Gojo-sensei!

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:53.930
Oh, he's awake.

01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:56.370
Hey, that's one of those
expensive chairs, isn't it?

Hey! Hurry up!

01:45:04.650 --> 01:45:07.840
