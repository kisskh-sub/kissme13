[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.060
Many years ago,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.490
on the land of the Tiemo people,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.740
a woman from Chang'an was captured.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.450
The Tiemo believed

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.330
she was a shadow guard.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.540
A shadow guard captured,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.410
and more shadow guards would come for her.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.410
Every shadow guard

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.820
carries invaluable military intelligence,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.570
immeasurable in worth.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.240
She was hung upon a turning pole,

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.430
used as bait.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.290
Under sun and rain,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.440
for seven days in full.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.380
No one came to save her.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.220
Even the Tiemo people

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.100
eventually lost interest in her.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.400
Except for one patient man.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.440
On the seventh night,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.850
the soldiers guarding her abandoned her,

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.820
thinking she was dead.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.000
And that man

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.550
had waited

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.740
for this very moment.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.160
He loved to gamble

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.910
and was skilled in disguise.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.660
He saw she was still alive

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.610
and knew a woman

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.380
who survived seven days

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.640
could not be a common shadow guard.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.480
She might be of the Huben Army.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.980
He helped her when her will

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.660
was weakest.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.650
He drew out key intelligence

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.900
and after he got what he needed,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.370
he then

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.980
killed her completely.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.800
That man

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.820
was calm

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.900
and cruel.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.110
That man,

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.580
back then in Tiemo,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.930
was known as a brilliant conspirator.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.580
The intelligence he obtained

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.580
turned the war in their favor.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.850
And so,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.370
he was awarded great military merit.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.390
After that,

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.020
he rose to become the new King of Tiemo.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.540
[Episode 23]

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.800
Wu Zhongheng.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.040
I never truly knew the man.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.610
He deceived my father,

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.730
and he deceived me as well.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.760
The Huben elites who came to save her that year

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.050
had already advanced deep into Chen Valley.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.520
I used the intel I coaxed out

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.600
of that woman,

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.620
I led a hundred Huben elites

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.690
straight into a granary,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.060
and left them to slaughter each other inside.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.890
What I never foresaw

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.220
was that one Huben elite

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.370
would make it out alive,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.620
and return to Chang'an.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.300
He grew in power afterward,

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.250
overtook me,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.220
and killed your father, Liu Ziwen.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.570
Then he reshaped the balance in Tiemo,

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.690
forcing my plans

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.740
to be delayed for fifteen more years.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.860
Yan Fengshan.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.360
A name one remembers

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.540
even at the brink of death.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.300
Perhaps

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.010
this is simply karma.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.860
White Hair.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.810
Back then, when I lived under the name Wu Zhongheng,

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.780
I moved among your father's generation.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.700
All those years,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.540
not once did I hear

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.050
anyone mention your mother.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:01.660
Where was she, I wonder?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.140
A woman

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.700
for whom a hundred Huben elites would give their lives

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:22.990
must have held

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.370
a noble and rare status.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.250
What a pity.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.700
I cut her down from that pole,

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.140
yet she left not a single word behind.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.100
Had she spoken even once,

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.700
it might have eased the longing

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.140
of a family somewhere in Chang'an.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.660
My mother is in the north.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.540
When all this ends,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.660
she will return.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.660
Is that so?

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.850
I hope you are right.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.780
Truth is,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.050
I never killed for pleasure.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.340
I killed only to reach

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.730
my goal.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.490
Nothing more.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.780
The deposed emperor is in your grasp,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.250
and so are my friends.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:33.970
These past days,

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.810
you have been waiting for me.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.900
Speak.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.090
What do you want of me?

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.890
Kill Xiao Wuyang for me.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.060
Why do you not do it yourself?

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.910
You endured fifteen years to stay alive,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.250
playing the long game for vengeance.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.130
And I endured twenty-five years.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.280
Of course I will leave the greatest chance

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.630
for myself.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.270
Very well.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.010
Then tell me,

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.160
why choose me?

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.690
Because you plotted the death of Yan Fengshan,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.660
which means you can

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.130
do it again

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.850
and bring me Xiao Wuyang's head.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.580
You truly are my mentor.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.300
I know one thing.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.490
On that throne in Chang'an,

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.650
there will never be room for two.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.030
As it stands,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.770
Tiemo is at our gates.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.100
I will help you kill him.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.300
But after it is done,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.610
you will release my friends.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.460
Do not worry.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.060
I

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.990
do not kill for pleasure.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.180
I kill only to achieve a goal.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.060
I took your friends only to force your hand.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.420
I made a promise to Gu Yu.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.570
He wished to die in his homeland,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.180
and I granted him that.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.140
If you kill Xiao Wuyang for me,

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.020
I will grant you the same,

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.210
your friends will be safe.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.140
Everything's nearly done.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:47.920
Dinner is ready.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.300
Thank you, my dear.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.820
Food is ready.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.420
Father, Mother, let's eat.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.620
Grandfather.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.330
Qinghe,

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.260
Come eat.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.000
Leave your grandpa alone.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.850
You little kid.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.450
Alright, Qinghe, no more fussing.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.600
Let's eat first.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.210
Here.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.340
Sit down first.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.630
Grandfather, I want meat.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.500
Meat? Meat it is, have some.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.690
Tasty.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.330
Grandmother, I'll feed you meat.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.040
Sit down first.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.850
- Sit and eat. - Come on, have some soup.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.030
What a handful.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.810
I don't pay what I owe.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.260
I'm shameless even when given face.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.930
I'm shameless even when given face.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:47.940
I'm no better than a beast.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.980
I borrow and never repay.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:49.890
I'm shameless even when given face.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.610
I'm no better than a beast.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.610
I owe and never repay.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.480
Truly penniless.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.220
So poor.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:55.850
Then why gamble?

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.100
A poor man only gambles to rise again.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.580
But alive and useless, what's the point?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:06.940
Tomorrow,

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.980
go fish with Liang.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.340
He's an honest man.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:11.610
You'll be paid daily.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.370
Thank you, Master Lu.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.300
Thank you, Master Lu.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.010
Master Lu,

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.400
you're like a second father to me.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.040
Thank you, Master Lu.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.220
I just worry you'll skip out,

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.460
and ruin my reputation.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.770
You'll see me every day after work.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.010
I'll take half your wages

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.250
until every debt is paid.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.300
If you slack off,

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.340
I'll cut your flesh to settle the debt.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.610
Your Majesty.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.490
You're back.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.650
The food is still warm.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.300
Good.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.820
Your Majesty.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.200
You're still badly injured.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.100
Why go out again?

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:47.700
You...

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.200
And those people, they…

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.180
They failed to kill me once.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.980
They'll try again.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.100
I need to be ready.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.730
Enough.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.100
It's alright now.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.490
Let's eat.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:05.820
Come.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.180
Come.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.890
Sit and eat with me.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.010
I have plenty.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.490
Here, there is no emperor.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.460
Only the shopkeeper

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.730
and the one he shelters.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.490
Sit, eat.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:26.980
Alright.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.890
Yan Fengshan is dead.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.700
Aside from that news,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.850
is there anything good to hear?

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.770
The armies surrounding the city have withdrawn.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.770
The forces of the regional commanders

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.490
are already returning to their feudal towns.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.890
Many people went out recently,

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.940
they saw it themselves.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.340
These days,

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.170
I walked along Cangshui River,

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.550
heard many talking

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.770
about the troop movements.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.220
It matches what you said.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.100
Why aren't you eating?

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:12.890
Eat.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.460
Sir.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:29.530
Come.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.890
Sit here. Talk with me for a while.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.120
Have you heard anything

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.700
about the Tiemo lately?

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.180
The Tiemo?

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.340
Your Majesty, we're in Chang'an.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.130
How could Tiemo people get in?

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.610
The ones who ambushed me that night

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.890
were Tiemo.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.180
I thought

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.290
they were sent by Yan Fengshan.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.980
Huben guards kill with precision,

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.740
nothing like

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.130
the sweeping blade work

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.090
of open battle.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.980
I fought in the northern front for years.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.940
I know their ways well.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.420
Those attackers that night

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.380
were Tiemo without a doubt.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.180
Enough.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.940
I met someone in Cangshui River today,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.420
a young debt collector

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.480
named Lu Xiaobing.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.570
Do you know of him?

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.010
I do.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.180
Cruel, ruthless man.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.620
Your Majesty, a life like gold,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.490
must never deal with someone like him.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.380
Sir.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.530
You are a little late.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.730
In your name,

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.700
I borrowed money from him.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.110
I expect he will

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.460
come looking for you soon.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.660
He will come here?

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.980
Your Majesty,

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.730
that exposes your location.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.290
What should we do?

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.550
How do we handle this?

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.770
Enough, sir.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.770
Do not worry.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.330
I have my own way.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.700
Several of my employers said the same.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.940
The salt-shop keeper borrowed gold.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.080
All added up,

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.770
it's about four liang now.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.000
Old man,

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:07.730
think carefully.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.890
Nine out, thirteen back.

(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.090
If you can't repay,

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.410
I'll burn your shop down.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.410
I will repay.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.260
And this one,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.090
the worn-out looking fellow here.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.050
What's your story?

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.300
I look worn-out?

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.530
A little.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.490
I'm the one who borrowed the gold.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.570
Here.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.980
Borrow so much money,

planning a business?

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.290
Or planning

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.050
to flee with it?

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.130
I want to pay you for your help.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.570
For you.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.760
Handle something for me.

[Warrant]

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:09.910
Who is he?

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.940
My brother.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.660
He's wanted.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.630
I believe

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.880
he'll show up around here.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.050
I'm waiting to meet him again.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.730
Keep an eye out for me every day.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.420
If you hear anything,

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.660
tell me at once,

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.050
quietly.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.810
Do it well,

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.700
and this gold

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.460
will be your reward.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.940
Let me get this straight.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.810
You borrowed money from several

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.660
of my employers,

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.620
then you handed that money back to me.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.420
And when it's time to collect,

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.250
I'll have to chase you for payment?

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.090
We'll talk about repayment when it's due.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.460
But for now,

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.530
I am your employer.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.140
Do the job well for me.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.530
You haven't eaten yet?

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.730
Waiting for you.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:24.660
Alright.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.330
Perfect timing then.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:27.770
We'll have something extra today.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.770
Listen,

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.140
I met a really

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.180
strange fellow today.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.420
He gave me four liang of gold.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.620
That much?

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.570
Yeah.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.010
Tell me, what brother

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.140
is worth four liang of gold?

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.570
Besides,

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:43.760
where am I supposed to find him a brother?

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.380
Xiaobing.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.250
I think maybe it's time.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:49.810
Time for what?

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.730
Xiaobing, you're not young anymore.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.330
You should find a wife.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.600
But dragging me along like baggage

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:56.570
won't help.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.770
If you knew some wealthy family,

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:00.570
fix me up a bit,

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.730
dress me like a boy,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.330
send me over as their little brother.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.810
You're dreaming way too big.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.770
Have I raised you for nothing all these years?

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.700
Besides,

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.620
if such luck really existed,

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:14.140
a rich family seeking a younger brother,

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.490
I should go first.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:17.840

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:19.460

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.140
Come on, have more. More meat.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:23.860

I'll keep looking after you.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.810
If I die,

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.460
then let it be a death for the realm.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.900
At least I won't shame the Xiao family.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.140
Put this on later.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.430

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:36.370
each has their own reason.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.540
Once duckweed takes root,

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.700
it becomes home.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.050
Who

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:47.980
would willingly leave

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.770
their home again?

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.980
The boatman in charge said

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.570
only his skiff can get outside.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.700
But that's not true.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.140
If one day

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.570
Your Majesty decides to leave,

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.180
you may find

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.460
an unsealed tunnel on that cliffside.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.800
It leads out.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:16.800
Your Majesty,

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.420
if that day comes,

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.440
I

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.400
will guide Your Majesty through.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.090
Me?

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.290
I cannot leave yet.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.490
I must wait for Xie Huai'an.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:38.490
Your Majesty.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.940
You gave him four liang of gold

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:48.940
just so he could

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.620
wander around here every day?

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.380
I'll think of him as my second pair of eyes.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.530
You saw it too, didn't you?

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.090
He's wearing the shoes I gave him.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.460
Anyone observant will notice.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.620
Through him,

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.990
news will find its way back to me.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.490
All for Xie Huai'an.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.980
Yes.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.610
The Tiemo assassins,

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.540
and Yan Fengshan's death,

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.300
all happened that same night.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.090
Six days have passed since then.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.820
Xie Huai'an still hasn't appeared.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.610
He leaves no trace when he acts.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:44.650
If he is late,

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.740
it means something went wrong.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:50.820
It seems even here,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.060
meeting him may not be easy.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.570
That child

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.850
has suffered too much.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.170
Child?

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:04.740
Sir.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.700
He even killed Yan Fengshan.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:10.850
This child may well be

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.980
the most terrifying person

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.090
in the empire.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:18.060
Your Majesty.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.300
When he was born,

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.170
I was already working in the Liu household.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.610
I watched with my own eyes

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.060
as his white hair turned black again.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.060
In my eyes,

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.130
he is still just a child.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.370
Do not worry.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.980
I will protect him well.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.170
You may live to see

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.610
his hair turn from black to white.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.590
Xie Huai'an,

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.240
you should be here by now.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.330
Have you ever thought about how you might die?

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.650
Mr. Huai'an looks gentle and refined,

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.170
but when you speak,

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.500
your words could chill a man to the bone.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:43.610
Gentle and refined, am I?

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:47.650
You are smart enough.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.060
You should know how this ends for you.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:52.540
I do not.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.460
Then please, enlighten me.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:56.890
You

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.540
will die long before you reach the summit.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.890
Why not at the summit?

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.140
Had it been thirty years earlier,

00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:09.820
you might have stood a chance.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.120
Back then, the founding emperor rose from nothing,

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.050
and my father

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.410
was still studying in the countryside.

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:19.780
The Grand Preceptor first made a living

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.330
selling pickled vegetables.

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:22.930
But in the end,

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.660
they both reached the peak.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.140
Envy.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:32.820
No need to envy them,

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:35.450
you simply chose the wrong road.

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:38.580
Did I?

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.620
Yan Fengshan, that great mountain, has already fallen.

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.010
Xiao Wenjing is already in our hands.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.700
Looking at the situation now,

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.370
only the Tiemo people

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.100
still have a chance to reach the summit.

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.300
As for me,

00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:58.490
I was born a Tiemo man.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.140
You are mistaken.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:11.700
Yan Fengshan never reached the peak,

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.530
and the Tiemo never will.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.140
[Warrant]

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.740
The wanted man is back.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:00.050
He must have seen

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.890
the shoes you gave me,

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:02.450
so he left that umbrella there on purpose.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.490
What is that supposed to mean?

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:10.850
This umbrella

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:12.530
once appeared

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:13.890
in a very large plot.

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:15.100
Back then,

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.660
he lost his only family.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.010
This is a warning to me

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.780
that there is a trap ahead.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:29.450
So

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:30.820
what does it have to do with you?

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:32.580
Enough.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.270
You did what I asked.

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.970
You may go.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:36.890
The four liang is yours.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.940
As for the rest,

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.410
I will repay the lenders gradually.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.850
Four liang for running an errand?

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.450
It was not just an errand, it was risky.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.580
Four liang, well deserved.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.050
I am not blind either.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:52.850
Your younger brother is no ordinary man.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.450
Someone is watching him.

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:56.180
And you are even less ordinary.

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:58.780
You want someone dead, do you not?

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.850
I, Lu Xiaobing, collect debts in Cangshui River.

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.140
Everyone knows I keep my word.

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:08.930
Not a coin short,

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:10.140
not a credit stolen.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.180
You paid me four liang,

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.050
I can do a little more for you.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.140
No need.

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:20.140
I know you have family.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.820
When young men try to be fearless,

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.850
they should think of home.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.580
Live well.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:28.700
Go on.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:02.530
The King of Tiemo is in the open now.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.070
We will face him this way.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:35.300
This blade of yours,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.100
can it kill Xiao Wuyang?

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.180
Of course not.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.660
Mr. Huai'an must know that already.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.620
No need to pry from me.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.260
As for others like me who hold blades,

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:46.780
how many there are,

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.100
or where they stand,

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:49.740
I know nothing of it.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.930
So you do not know

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.140
the final killing move.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.010
You are not at the core of this.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:00.970
Does Mr. Huai'an know it then?

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.180
Think a little more,

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.530
and the answer comes naturally.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.410
Set head against head,

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:21.970
we can never match Xiao Wuyang.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:26.820
According to the plan,

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.580
there is a teahouse by the mudflat ahead.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.490
That's the best spot for us to wait

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.620
for Xiao Wuyang.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.010
Even if shadow guards crowd the area,

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.530
he will not win

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.740
by ambush alone.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:42.870
As for my mentor,

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:44.450
he wants to take down the King of Death.

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:46.100
I find myself truly curious

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.140
about what move he plans to use.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.160
"Play the prey first.

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.940
[Play the prey first. Then kill the hunter.]

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.890
Then kill the hunter."
