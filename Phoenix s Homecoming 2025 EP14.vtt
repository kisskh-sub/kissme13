00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.680
(It's Huaiyong's handwriting.)

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.000
(How have you been?)

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.519
Has anyone bullied you?

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.280
Everything is fine.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:37.400
No one dares to bully me.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.519
You can tell me anything.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.200
I've made

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.000
significant progress
with the investigation.

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:47.439
I'll return

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.159
to see you soon.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.120
I was out on business today

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.120
and came across
a temple fair in the mountains.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.439
People were making wishes there.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.120
You present yourself as my fiancée.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.120
How I wish all this were real.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.960
I wrote you a prayer charm.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.800
May you have peace and good health.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.599
I had time to kill,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.280
so I needed something to do.

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.280
Your hairpin

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.639
is almost ready.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.319
I remember that you loved

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.039
crabapple blossoms at the academy.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.120
You used to mock our classmate Chu

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.360
that he was eager

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.919
to go home every day.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.120
Now I truly understand how he felt.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.919
Remember.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.039
Take good care of yourself.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.360
I'm always

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.919
thinking of you.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.639
So this is how it feels

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.439
to have someone care about me.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.240
(To Huaiyong.)

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560
(I hope you are well.)

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.159
(I came to the palace)

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.800
(because an old piece of pawn
may prove crucial)

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.639
(at a critical moment.)

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.000
(The Sheng army's name wasn't cleared.)

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.360
(I won't act recklessly.)

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.520
(Once you return,)

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.080
(we'll devise a plan.)

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:46.360
(Don't worry.)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.680
The guards are changed at midnight.

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.319
You're on duty, Commander Wei.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.639
Why would you have time
to wander around Yeyou Court?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.599
Are you meeting someone?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.599
Who are you really?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.600
Commander, do you
recognize this tiger tally?

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.240
No way.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.040
But you clearly...

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:31.600
Back then,

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.360
the wronged souls of the Weiyang Palace
and the Sheng army

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.959
dragged me back from the underworld.

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.879
Years ago, I placed a pawn
in the palace.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.079
This pawn was never activated.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:50.439
The day has come.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.959
I've also

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.399
been waiting for this day.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.319
I, Commander Sheng Weiling
of the Sheng army,

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:03.079
pay my respects to Your Highness.

00:05:18.272 --> 00:05:24.736
(Sheng)

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.040
Commander Wei.

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.519
I wonder if that fire years ago

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.560
had burned away your loyalty.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.160
I should have died

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:45.199
when the Sheng army was annihilated.

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:48.120
I've clung to life

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.040
only to clear

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:54.160
the Sheng army's name one day.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.199
The tally is complete.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.120
I swear to protect
Your Highness with my life.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.639
Despite all hardships,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.040
I will never retreat.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.560
It's the incense my sister used.

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:41.079
You did serve at the Weiyang Palace.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.639
That's right.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.000
No water's enough after seeing the sea.

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:51.160
No clouds but those
of Mount Wu please me.

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:30.319
Yu.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:31.439
Yunlin.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.959
Is that you?

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.399
I know

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.800
you keep an eternal lamp
in your chamber.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.839
You called me back with your longing.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.399
You missed me, too?

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:51.079
I missed you, too.

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:09.879
What?

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:11.600
Don't you want me?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.360
Yunlin.

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:23.559
You drugged me last night?

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:31.279
Your Majesty.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.519
If we share affection,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.799
why would I drug you?

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.679
You were so vigorous last night.

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:45.279
My back still aches from it.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:48.200
I hope tonight

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:51.240
you could be gentler.

00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:58.519
I can tolerate your usual schemes

00:09:58.639 --> 00:09:59.600
and tricks.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.559
But if you play tricks

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.240
on things related to my sister,

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:05.480
I won't let it slide.

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:08.279
An obedient empress will stay longer

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:09.039
in her position.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.759
Your Majesty.

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:12.080
Your Majesty,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.240
do you despise me this much?

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:18.720
We married at a young age, after all.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.360
I only long for
Your Majesty's affection.

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:29.720
Somebody.

00:10:31.968 --> 00:10:33.120
Your Majesty, you're awake.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.600
Let us help you dress.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.399
Go.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.679
Bring the contraceptive decoction.

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:42.639
Your Majesty.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.679
Your Majesty.

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:48.440
I come from a prestigious family.

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:50.320
I'm intelligent and studious.

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:53.080
The Grand Princess herself
appointed me as empress.

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:57.200
I've served you with

00:10:57.759 --> 00:10:59.320
utmost care and respect

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.720
and governed with kindness.

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:02.080
I have never...

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.720
If not for the Grand Princess,

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:05.799
why would I make you the empress?

00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:10.080
Your Majesty...

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:15.600
My apologies, Your Majesty.

00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:18.320
Will you drink this medicine yourself?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.840
Or shall I...?

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:30.039
I just want you to understand.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:32.240
Don't covet things

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:34.120
that don't belong to you.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.879
(Your Majesty.)

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.279
(You reject my love.)

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.559
(Then let me hate you instead.)

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.080
(We're both pitiful souls.)

00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:47.840
(Perhaps hatred)

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:50.679
(is more fitting for this cold place.)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.559
Your Majesty.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.919
Is something wrong?

00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:24.840
No.

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:26.159
Nothing.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.080
But I bet

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:29.639
you've been bored

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.039
watching me work

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:32.840
these days.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.919
I've only been reading.

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:38.759
But Your Majesty

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.039
manages countless affairs
and must take care of yourself.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:43.680
With a beauty by my side,

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.240
even tedious paperwork

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.480
feels no burden.

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:05.759
Your Majesty must be busy.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.240
I shall take my leave first.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.000
No need.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.720
Wait in the inner chamber.

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:12.440
Your Majesty, it's against the rules.

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:13.639
I made the rules.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.944
No one dares to comment.

00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:29.480
I pay respects to Your Majesty.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.600
May Your Majesty be well.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.480
Rise.

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:39.080
Quezhou's travel permits
raise suspicions.

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:42.279
Tracking the gunpowder trail downward,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I found that thirty percent
went to Qi State

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.320
and the rest

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:48.416
went to Hutou Mountain,

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:50.759
thirty li outside the capital,
through secret tunnels.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.279
Your Majesty,

00:13:53.759 --> 00:13:55.159
I believe the mastermind

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.000
likely targets the capital.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.519
If Your Majesty deploys troops
to surround the mountains now,

00:14:03.879 --> 00:14:05.519
once the Zhuozhou case is solved,

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.000
we can lure the snake out of its hole.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.440
What an excellent plan.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.559
Are you lecturing me

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.840
on military deployment tactics?

00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:22.720
I dare not.

00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:24.360
It's just that...

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:24.960
Your Majesty.

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:27.639
Isn't His Majesty reviewing memorials?

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:29.919
Why can't I enter?

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:33.200
Your Majesty,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.240
perhaps it's best
Her Majesty doesn't know I'm here.

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:39.240
Your Majesty,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.360
His Majesty doesn't allow anyone in.

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:43.480
Please return.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.440
I know

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.159
His Majesty is hiding his new favorite.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.879
He's hiding that vixen inside.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.759
What are they doing in there?

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.200
If she covets my position,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.200
I'll relinquish it immediately.
