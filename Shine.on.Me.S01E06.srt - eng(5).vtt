[Episode 6]

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.060
Mr. Lin.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.000
I'll head back

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.560
and touch base with Mr. Ba
at Shengyuan Finance.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.920
Mr. Lin.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.150
Do you

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.039
have a moment?

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.090
Shut the door.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.090
What's the matter?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.870
I wonder how he'd look

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.970
in a white lab coat.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.020
Here's the thing.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.430
I've noticed

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.300
a clear breach of company regulations.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.250
If we don't

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.410
fix this,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.800
it's going to seriously undermine

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.000
our credibility.

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:56.750
Be more specific.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.240
Yin Jie, Yuhua, and I joined
way before the new hire did.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.130
But Logistics went ahead
and gave the Building 1 dorm

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.000
to him.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.930
You came to me

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.740
just for this?

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.020
Yeah.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.800
Mr. Tong,

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:23.630
come to my office.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.460
I'm so sorry.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.780
This was a complete oversight
on our part.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.620
We were only looking
at the new application forms

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.560
and completely overlooked the staff

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.460
who joined earlier.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.470
It's fine.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.000
I just hope

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.240
you can get this sorted out
as soon as possible.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.579
Well...

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.680
he's moved in.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.690
We'll have to talk to him first.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.250
It might be...

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.300
Your oversight

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.740
did indeed cause trouble for others.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.340
An apology is in order,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.020
and you should make
the proper arrangements.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.970
Yes, sir.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.360
But I just ran into Mr. Mo

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.370
on my way here.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.180
What does Mr. Mo have to do with this?

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.269
Mr. Mo.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.480
I see.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.620
But someone

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.300
has brought this to my attention.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.010
If we don't handle this properly,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.420
I'm afraid it won't sit well
with the team.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.190
Of course,

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.430
we'll stick strictly to company policy.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.390
This was

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.860
a massive oversight by Logistics.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.330
It's got nothing to do with you.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.360
I'm sure the others

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.120
won't hold it against you.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.800
I'll go talk

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.220
to him right away

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.690
and get the dorms sorted out.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.690
There's just one thing, though.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.800
We only have one room available,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.040
with only two beds.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.510
But there are three of you.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.920
How should we split it?

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.890
The other two will move there.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.250
Understood, Mr. Lin.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.160
I'll go handle the arrangements now.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.220
Miss Nie,

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.390
got any issues

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.060
with the way I handled that?

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.950
Not at all.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.160
I figured as much.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.300
Since you're so set on

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.130
playing the "commoner,"

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.870
I'm sure you won't mind

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.870
a bit of a downgrade
in living standards.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.000
I finally figured out

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.510
why he's always giving me a hard time.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.070
Why is it that every cute guy

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.270
I meet

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.570
just has to make my life miserable?

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.130
Isn't that a good thing?

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.040
If a knockout
were giving me a hard time,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.420
I'd be thrilled.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.300
Jiang Rui.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.980
Didn't you ask him

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.120
how he found out who you really are?

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.620
Of course I did.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.130
But you really think he'd just

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.930
play along and tell me?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.890
It's not really

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:10.770
that much of a surprise.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.450
He was transferred

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.130
from HQ, after all.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.010
It's only natural

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.890
he'd know you were here.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.540
It's just his attitude
that's so annoying.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.450
Xiguang.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.100
He's a surgeon

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.130
who made DM

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.510
in just one year.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.510
Doesn't that strike you

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.300
as odd?

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:26.680
I've thought about it.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.130
But it's not like

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.300
it has anything to do with me.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:30.220
No.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.130
Maybe it's got nothing to do with you,

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.000
but what about your dad?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.240
I heard

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.190
the infighting at Shengyuan

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.190
has been pretty bad
these last few years.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.270
The old man

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.190
is about to name his successor,

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.070
and he's got a lot of sons.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.920
Your dad

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.540
is close with his eldest,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.060
Sheng Bokai.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.000
We don't know

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.060
whose side your boss's on,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.370
but he's definitely not

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.120
in Sheng Bokai's camp.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:46.620
So, I've been thinking

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.310
you're just caught in the crossfire.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.659
No way.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.159
I just don't get the feeling

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.010
that he's the type

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.540
to take out his frustrations on others

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.560
just because of some power struggle.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.950
He's got this aura about him,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.600
like he's completely

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.740
above all that.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.360
He used to be a doctor, right?

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.750
He seems like the kind

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.890
who's far too principled
to ever take a bribe.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.180
Seriously, Xiguang?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.800
After how he treated you,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.310
you're still saying he's a good guy?

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.860
Sounds like you're catching feelings,

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.390
Xiguang.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.010
That's a completely separate issue.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.930
Jiang Rui.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.660
Shanghai isn't far from Suzhou.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.860
It's only ten minutes away
by high-speed rail.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.120
Don't be surprised if I show up
at your school to "visit".

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.950
Alright,

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.560
I'm done messing with you.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.100
I'll stop.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.430
But you're right.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.120
Those people play dirty.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.100
If he really wanted
to make your life miserable,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.620
he wouldn't make it this obvious.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.430
He's way too smart for that.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.130
Are you calling me stupid?

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.010
Of course not.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.540
But in that case,

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.240
I think there's only

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.070
one possibility left.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.310
Did you do something bad

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.220
that gave him

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.180
a really bad impression?

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.070
No way.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.750
I...

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.190
Tell me everything.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.750
In your dreams.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.300
I'm hanging up.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.370
Why are you guys just sitting there?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.010
Get your stuff together
and move into the new dorm.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.289
Dorm Management called

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.530
right before they clocked out.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.890
They said the room in Building 1

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.289
have been cleared and cleaned.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:45.620
Talk about efficiency.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.010
Only Mr. Lin could pull that off.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:52.980
Xiguang,

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.750
we can't take the room.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.390
I feel terrible already

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.440
for not backing you up

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.370
when you went to see Mr. Lin today.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.410
You were the one who stepped up,

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.120
but we're the ones getting the perks.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.370
It just doesn't feel right.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.620
Going to see Mr. Lin was my own choice.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.050
It's totally normal

that you didn't react in time.

Besides, Mr. Lin

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.860

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.500
I just wanted to make him

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.600
do some actual work for once.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.650
It's not on you.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.100
Plus, the final decision
on who gets Building 1

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.620
was based on who joined first.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.820
If I moved in,

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:22.770
it wouldn't be fair.

No buts.

why are you calling me at this hour?

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.600
Don't tell me you're
pulling overtime like I am.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:52.890
Go ahead, I'm listening.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:53.940
Okay.

from Mr. Sheng Bokai himself?

Don't worry about the details.

Actually, the problem
is if you do it too well.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.010
With the PV market as it is,

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.500

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.980
and you're already hunting for heads.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:49.170
Tell me.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:51.530
What else

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:52.650
did you find on this person?

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.670
Nothing gets past you, does it?

00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:58.360
He called me unprofessional

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.550
in front of the staff.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.510
Said I can't lead.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.000
Don't I have any pride?

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.440
So you just want to pull the rug out

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.090
from under him?

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.340
Immature.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.260
You've got to learn
to play the long game.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:14.420
I'll

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:15.940
handle this.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.550
You stay out of it.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.400
Thanks, Grandpa.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.870
[Shengyuan Group]

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.570
Dig up some dirt on him

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.170
from his time at Shengyuan.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.630
Don't tie Shuangyuan

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:33.570
to the grounds for the investigation.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.380
You're still

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.000
shielding Yusen.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:40.000
Or Bokai

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.010
would get the wrong idea.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:42.940
Why else

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:44.650
would he come to me?

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.960
With all the dirt he's got,

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.130
he could've finished the job himself.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.670
Not necessarily.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.150
He holds you in such high regard

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.590
and would never act
without checking with you first.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:58.360
He's

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.130
thorough, sharp,

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.480
a natural-born player.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.130
Such a pity.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:12.630
Seriously,

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.920
I'm

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.630
at capacity.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.440
So

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.400
where to next?

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.480
There's a café right nearby.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.690
Their afternoon tea is famous.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.840
Want to head over and hang out?

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:28.840
Please, no.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:30.650
I'm begging you.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:31.960
Can we please do something else?

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.630
But their cakes are amazing.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.380
Especially the strawberry mille-feuille.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:43.690
No way.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:45.170
I'm full up to my neck.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:59.460
But my knees really hurt.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.190
I can't walk another step.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:03.000
Stop being such a brat.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.570
Even though Xiguang started this,

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.090
Yin Jie,

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.940
you have zero self-control.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.150
Weren't you supposed to be on a diet?

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.690
All those days of starving yourself
went down the drain.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.280
That's exactly

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.500
why I'm like this.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.690
Do you have any idea

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.840
what it's like to stare

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.280
at your favorite food

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.230
and not be allowed

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.920
to touch it?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.550
The more you suppress the urge,

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:46.050
the harder

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.070
it is to control.

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:48.480
Then you'll just snap.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.420
The more you hold it in,
the harder it is to resist.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.130
If I just hadn't seen the food at all,

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:55.800
I would've been fine.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.820
You people who've never dieted

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.880
wouldn't understand.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.210
The more you hold it in,

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.480
the harder it is to resist?

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.670
Exactly.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.780
So, a sudden impulse isn't something

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.590
to be ashamed of.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.760
It doesn't mean you're weak,

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.630
right?

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.840
Of course not.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.980
It's just a buffer.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.440
A way of taking things slow.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:24.710
Thank you.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.480
For what?

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:27.920
I think my love handles

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.690
should be the one thanking you.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:33.730
Xiguang,

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.570
you've been staring out there forever.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:36.570
See any hot guys?

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:38.500
I haven't seen a single one.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:39.630
I've been watching that building

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:40.610
across the street,

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.510
but it's just security guards

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:42.610
going in and out.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.230
I've been meaning to ask,

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.070
it's Saturday, right?

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.820
Hot guys don't work on Saturdays.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.210
Oh, right.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.320
It is Saturday.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.550
If it weren't Saturday,

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.960
how would we have time
to come to Shanghai?

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:06.570
All this overtime
has turned my brain into mush.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.050
Xiguang really led us
on a wild goose chase.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.300
Xiguang,

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.960
just admit it.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.070
You're a total foodie.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.710
You just came here for the food.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.710
I'm sorry.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:26.730
What are you apologizing for?

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.210
I'm having a blast

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:30.280
eating all this.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.630
Let's keep going.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.480
Anyway, the calories are already in.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.280
Might as well go down swinging.
