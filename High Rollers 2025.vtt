kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.478
Nice view.

00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:28.827
Oh, it is.

00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:32.657
You know this is number 37.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.399
Number 37?

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:37.140
Yeah.

00:01:37.227 --> 00:01:40.665
It's our 37th beach we've
visited since our retirement.

00:01:40.752 --> 00:01:42.189
You're counting?

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:43.538
- Yeah. Well, you know--
- Oh, my God.

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:46.410
Take a girl out of the FBI,
but you know,

00:01:46.497 --> 00:01:47.411
I'm a little OCD.

00:01:47.498 --> 00:01:48.760
I can't help it.

00:01:48.847 --> 00:01:49.674
- You are, and you know what?
- Are we sure? What?

00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:51.589
You know what?

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:54.549
I think--
I think this 37th beach

00:01:54.636 --> 00:01:55.376
is my favorite--

00:01:55.463 --> 00:01:56.768
Mm.

00:01:56.855 --> 00:01:58.553
Because it feels like you and me
are the only people

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.294
in the world.

00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:01.251
Oh, yeah. I love it.

00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:02.165
What are you guys talking about?

00:02:03.514 --> 00:02:04.254
And then there's my brother.

00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:05.473
Mm-hmm.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.127
- We're talking about you.
- Me?

00:02:07.214 --> 00:02:08.084
How good you are.

00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:09.303
And how much we love you.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.565
- Hey.
- Aw, I love you guys.

00:02:10.652 --> 00:02:11.609
Hey, who's this?

00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:13.481
Can we get this party started?

00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:14.917
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:16.223
I haven't had a drink all day.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.963
The gang's all here.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.834
Let's go. Let's get it.

00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:20.575
Okay, pastor.

00:02:23.317 --> 00:02:25.232
Dearly beloved,

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.713
we are gathered here today
to commemorate

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.587
the union of two people near
and dear to us,

00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:36.852
our sister, Link,
and George Caras.

00:02:39.768 --> 00:02:43.250
And I gotta admit, Caras,
I ain't like your ass at first.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.513
Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.992
I was a little uptight.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.255
A little uptight?

00:02:48.342 --> 00:02:49.734
You were a fucking brick, homie,
straight up.

00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:50.909
Yeah.

00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:52.781
And then you loosened up.
You grew a beard.

00:02:52.868 --> 00:02:53.782
You know what?

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:54.652
Let me tell you something.

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.611
You made Link happy, finally.

00:02:56.698 --> 00:02:57.960
And we're all good.

00:02:58.047 --> 00:02:59.135
Let's just keep going.

00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:00.571
Look at her. She's glowing.

00:03:00.658 --> 00:03:01.703
- She's glowing.
- Glowing!

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:03.531
Thank you, guys.

00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:05.924
You break her heart,
I break your neck.

00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:06.882
Come on. Let's keep goin'.

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:07.839
Let's keep goin'.

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:09.537
Hold on. I'm runnin' this show.

00:03:09.624 --> 00:03:11.713
I got ordained online
and everything for this shit.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.757
Excuse me, Lord.

00:03:14.803 --> 00:03:19.721
Do you, Caras,
take this beautiful woman, Link,

00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:22.506
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

00:03:22.593 --> 00:03:27.642
to love and to hold through
the good times and the bad,

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.644
till death do your part?

00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:32.603
I do.

00:03:34.518 --> 00:03:37.956
And do you, Link,
take this man--

00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:51.013
All right, come on,
come here, come here.

00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:55.235
Oh, my God!

00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:01.980
Tell you right now,

00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:03.982
anybody was on that boat
they're barbecue.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.070
I know. I know.

00:04:05.157 --> 00:04:06.898
But what if this
were a distraction?

00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:08.726
You mean like when we blew up
that limo in Ibiza?

00:04:31.053 --> 00:04:32.402
Oh, shit! There's two of them.

00:04:45.546 --> 00:04:46.764
Fuck!

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:05.914
They got guns, man.
Let's go! Let's go!

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.292
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.250
Don't fight them!
They'll kill you!

00:05:44.082 --> 00:05:45.562
They got the drop on us, guys.

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:47.085
Hell no, man!

00:06:05.756 --> 00:06:07.410
Target has been captured.

00:06:07.497 --> 00:06:08.803
Copy that.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.413
Sniper one heading back to base.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.853
Mason, wait.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.680
Where-- where you headed?

00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:33.567
Not a good time, Shawn.

00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:34.829
Wait, Mason, don't hang up!

00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:39.007
Looks like we have a tail.

00:06:40.051 --> 00:06:41.836
Copy that.

00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:44.882
Backup on route.
Sniper one on the way.

00:07:00.898 --> 00:07:02.291
Sniper two,
we have eyes on target.

00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:03.423
Eyes on target.

00:07:06.338 --> 00:07:08.863
Copy that. Take the shot.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:36.847
Take the shot.

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:08.966
What is it?

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.707
It's gone!

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:14.058
I-- it's-- it's gone?

00:08:14.145 --> 00:08:15.582
What's gone?

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:17.627
I mean,
it's fucking gone!

00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:21.239
Not just the dirt box,
my entire server has been wiped.

00:08:21.326 --> 00:08:22.719
You have a backup to this?

00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:24.547
Of course.
I have redundancy.

00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:26.810
But that server's
been wiped, too.

00:08:26.897 --> 00:08:29.465
But you said it was impossible
for this to be hacked.

00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:30.945
So how could that be?

00:08:31.032 --> 00:08:32.120
It-- it was.

00:08:32.207 --> 00:08:33.208
Well, how did it happen?

00:08:33.295 --> 00:08:35.079
I don't know, Mason!
I don't know!

00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:37.212
Hey, sweetie.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:38.866
It's not your fault, okay?

00:08:38.953 --> 00:08:40.694
- Yes, it is.
- No.

00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:41.912
- My fault.
- No, no, no, no, no.

00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:43.261
He's right.
It's not your fault.

00:08:43.348 --> 00:08:45.437
Something else is--
something else is goin' on.

00:08:46.613 --> 00:08:48.049
So-- so what's gonna happen?

00:08:48.136 --> 00:08:51.356
I mean, isn't the dirt box
the only thing keepin' us alive?

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.620
If Salazar has that copy,

00:08:53.707 --> 00:08:55.404
I'm tellin' you
he'll kill all of us.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.103
Whatever happen,
we gotta stick together.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.845
If I go down, I'm gonna
go down protecting y'all.

00:09:01.932 --> 00:09:03.412
Nobody's goin' down.

00:09:03.499 --> 00:09:05.806
uh, they--
they want something from us.

00:09:05.893 --> 00:09:08.286
They want something from us.

00:09:08.373 --> 00:09:10.158
Otherwise, we'd all be dead.

00:09:10.245 --> 00:09:11.638
Think about the beach.

00:09:11.725 --> 00:09:14.249
They would've killed us
if they didn't want something.

00:09:14.336 --> 00:09:15.380
If he has the dirt box,

00:09:15.467 --> 00:09:16.860
what do we have
that Salazar could want?

00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:18.340
We have the know-how, man.

00:09:18.427 --> 00:09:19.863
We've proven it.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.170
How many times have we pulled
this kind of thing off?

00:09:22.257 --> 00:09:23.519
We got the team.

00:09:23.606 --> 00:09:25.608
We got Hector and Anton.

00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:27.305
They're the best crowd control.

00:09:27.392 --> 00:09:30.004
We've got Link who knows more
than fucking Steve Jobs

00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:31.919
and Elon Musk put together.

00:09:32.006 --> 00:09:33.529
You-- you, Shawn, you--

00:09:33.616 --> 00:09:36.488
I've never known a safe that
you haven't been able to bust.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.535
And Caras, we have you now
on our team, not theirs.

00:09:39.622 --> 00:09:41.058
That's big, man.

00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:43.017
I know finance.

00:09:43.104 --> 00:09:45.193
I know more about Abel Salazar
than I care to.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.282
And we're gonna use that.
We're gonna need that.

00:09:48.283 --> 00:09:49.589
Okay.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.636
So, what are we talkin' about,
Mason?

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.685
Abel Salazar wants us
to do a job.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.165
That simple.

00:10:01.252 --> 00:10:02.036
A job?

00:10:02.123 --> 00:10:03.733
He wants our team.

00:10:04.516 --> 00:10:05.735
That's what he wants.

00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:08.346
And you know what?

00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:09.565
Here it is.

00:10:16.572 --> 00:10:17.617
Hello?

00:10:17.704 --> 00:10:18.705
Hello, Mason.

00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:20.184
Who is this?

00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:22.578
We met in Seattle.

00:10:22.665 --> 00:10:25.015
Let me guess. This is Flowers.

00:10:26.495 --> 00:10:28.279
And Salazar wants us
to do a job for him.

00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:29.759
Is that right?

00:10:29.846 --> 00:10:31.500
Very astute.

00:10:31.587 --> 00:10:33.981
And payment for successful
completion of the assignment

00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:36.592
will be the safe return
of Amelia Decker.

00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:38.681
Why don't you just
return Amy right now?

00:10:38.768 --> 00:10:40.074
She's-- she's great
at logistics.

00:10:40.161 --> 00:10:41.205
She could help us.

00:10:41.771 --> 00:10:42.946
And give up our leverage?

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.819
Come on, leverage.

00:10:45.906 --> 00:10:48.082
Salazar could kill us
anytime, anywhere.

00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:49.649
You know that.

00:10:49.736 --> 00:10:52.303
She-- he-- he-- he doesn't need
to use Decker's leverage.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.697
This is not a negotiation.

00:10:54.784 --> 00:10:58.353
Complete the job,
get Decker back.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.747
Okay, what is the job?
What are we doing?

00:11:03.488 --> 00:11:05.969
You're on a need-to-know basis,
Mason.

00:11:06.056 --> 00:11:08.058
Your team
will be picked up in one hour
from your hotel.

00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:09.625
And-- and where are we going?

00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:15.109
As I said, you are always
on a need-to-know.

00:11:15.196 --> 00:11:16.719
You know what?

00:11:16.806 --> 00:11:19.113
This conversation ends right now
unless you put Amy on the phone.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.419
Put Amy on the phone!

00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:24.031
Certainly.

00:11:24.118 --> 00:11:25.554
We're not barbarians.

00:11:34.824 --> 00:11:36.043
For you.

00:11:37.174 --> 00:11:38.698
Thank you.

00:11:40.264 --> 00:11:42.789
Well, here we are again.

00:11:42.876 --> 00:11:44.878
Separated and on the phone.

00:11:46.183 --> 00:11:47.532
Yeah, I know.

00:11:47.619 --> 00:11:50.187
But last time you, uh, you were
working for the FBI

00:11:50.274 --> 00:11:53.669
and-- and, uh, you betrayed me.

00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:54.931
Yeah.

00:11:55.018 --> 00:11:56.498
Look how that worked out.

00:11:56.585 --> 00:11:58.892
Pretty good, I think.

00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:00.763
Oh, please tell me
that you're okay.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.591
It's not the first time
I've been tased.

00:12:03.548 --> 00:12:04.680
You should see the other guy.

00:12:04.767 --> 00:12:07.204
I'd put a little ice
on that if I were you.

00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:11.339
I'm so sorry, Amy.

00:12:11.426 --> 00:12:13.123
I let my guard down.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.734
Mason, don't do that.

00:12:14.821 --> 00:12:16.083
It's not your fault.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.258
If they didn't get me there,

00:12:17.345 --> 00:12:19.434
they would have gotten me
somewhere else.

00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:22.176
What Abel Salazar wants,
he gets.

00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:25.266
I promise you I'll get you back.

00:12:25.353 --> 00:12:26.876
I know you will.

00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:29.096
Looks like we're takin' off.

00:12:29.183 --> 00:12:30.662
Tak-- you on a plane?

00:12:33.448 --> 00:12:35.972
Amy, are you on a plane?

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:37.060
Amy?

00:12:41.064 --> 00:12:42.718
Fuck!

00:12:45.808 --> 00:12:46.548
Hey, how you doing?

00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:47.854
I'm Agent Richter.

00:12:47.941 --> 00:12:49.551
Looking for a few people

00:12:49.638 --> 00:12:50.770
that might have checked
into this hotel.

00:12:56.036 --> 00:12:58.125
Does this look familiar to you?

00:12:58.212 --> 00:12:59.779
- Like this guy over here.
- No.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.699
Move, move!

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:09.005
They're there!
Come on!

00:13:09.092 --> 00:13:10.354
Lock it down!

00:13:10.833 --> 00:13:12.922
Hey, Link,
you gotta move out now.

00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:14.097
The feds are back. Call Flowers.

00:13:14.184 --> 00:13:15.707
Hey guys, got room for one more?

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.535
- Bro, take the next.
- Man, I gotta get to a meeting.

00:13:17.622 --> 00:13:19.886
Get on the fuckin' next one.

00:13:19.973 --> 00:13:20.712
Rude.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.713
Let's go.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:22.714
Hold that elevator!

00:13:23.628 --> 00:13:24.586
Stop!

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.551
Are you sure
this the only way down?

00:13:33.638 --> 00:13:35.031
Uh.

00:13:35.118 --> 00:13:36.728
We got 12 feet of water, man.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.165
You want us to jump?

00:13:38.252 --> 00:13:39.819
- Just skim. Just skim.
- Are you sure about this, man?

00:13:39.906 --> 00:13:41.081
We're running out of time, guys.

00:13:41.168 --> 00:13:42.125
They're almost here.

00:13:43.692 --> 00:13:45.172
- Come on, man. They're comin'.
- Shit!

00:13:50.525 --> 00:13:52.179
Jump! Come on!

00:13:57.227 --> 00:13:58.838
- You got this.
- No!

00:14:08.543 --> 00:14:09.370
Oh, fuck.

00:14:09.457 --> 00:14:10.197
Let's go.

00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:11.241
Oh, my God.

00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:12.242
Come on.

00:14:13.461 --> 00:14:15.680
Oh, I can't believe
I did that still.

00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:20.033
Link and Caras in there?

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.817
They're inside! Get in!

Least I get to cross
another state off my list.

00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:48.121
You are the ultimate optimist,
Shawn.

00:15:48.208 --> 00:15:50.732
I think that's your superpower.

00:15:50.819 --> 00:15:52.212
I really do.

00:15:54.823 --> 00:15:58.392
The Scarlet Pearl
International Hotel and Casino.

00:15:58.479 --> 00:16:01.917
A decadent playground
for the rich and famous.

00:16:02.004 --> 00:16:04.267
Huh, oh, this is a casino gig?

00:16:04.354 --> 00:16:05.442
I'm all ears.

00:16:06.356 --> 00:16:08.880
This is the owner
of the whole enterprise.

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.665
Zade Black.

00:16:10.752 --> 00:16:13.450
He made a name
for himself in the
shrimping industry.

00:16:13.537 --> 00:16:16.976
One of his processing plants
is behind the hotel.

00:16:17.063 --> 00:16:19.935
Now he has his hands in
all kinds of illicit activities.

00:16:20.022 --> 00:16:21.806
He uses the casino
and his shrimp empire

00:16:21.893 --> 00:16:23.025
to launder money.

00:16:23.112 --> 00:16:25.810
By all accounts,
he is very charming

00:16:25.897 --> 00:16:29.162
and also an extremely
dangerous sociopath.

00:16:29.814 --> 00:16:31.512
Kind of sounds like your boss.

00:16:33.035 --> 00:16:34.776
So what's the score?

00:16:34.863 --> 00:16:36.734
The top floor of the hotel...

00:16:36.821 --> 00:16:39.650
...is Black's personal
penthouse suite.

00:16:39.737 --> 00:16:42.523
Inside the penthouse is a safe.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.266
You must find a way
to access it.

00:16:46.353 --> 00:16:48.398
What's in the safe?

00:16:48.485 --> 00:16:50.531
You'll be told
when the time is right.

00:16:50.618 --> 00:16:51.793
What kind of safe
are we talking about?

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.360
I don't know.

00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:56.885
Okay, well, do you know
where it might be in the suite?

00:16:57.407 --> 00:16:59.105
I'm not here to do your job.

00:16:59.192 --> 00:17:00.889
You have to find it.

00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:03.848
There are only two access
points

00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:07.026
via a private elevator
and the emergency exit.

00:17:07.113 --> 00:17:09.028
There are armed guards
in the suite at all times.

00:17:09.115 --> 00:17:12.596
Moreover, every inch
is monitored 24/7

00:17:12.683 --> 00:17:13.641
by security cameras.

00:17:13.728 --> 00:17:15.121
What kind of cameras?

00:17:15.208 --> 00:17:16.731
He doesn't know, Link,

00:17:16.818 --> 00:17:18.602
because apparently
the Salazar group

00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:20.996
isn't as all-knowing
as they pretend to be.

00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:21.823
- Oh.
- What do you know?

00:17:22.867 --> 00:17:24.260
This is no snatch and grab job.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:28.395
The local authorities
are in Zade Black's pocket.

00:17:28.482 --> 00:17:31.441
So, even if you make the street,
that's the end of the road.

00:17:31.528 --> 00:17:32.747
For all of you.

00:17:32.834 --> 00:17:34.662
I think it's a piece of cake.

00:17:34.749 --> 00:17:36.533
Yeah, sounds easy.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.536
All right, do you have a picture
of the suite, at least?

00:17:39.623 --> 00:17:40.581
Only one.

00:17:40.668 --> 00:17:42.191
Okay, let's see it.

00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:50.460
Let's zoom in
so we can see the background.

00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:57.815
Link, help him. Come.

00:17:57.902 --> 00:17:59.252
Let-- let her do it.

00:18:03.256 --> 00:18:04.779
- Step aside.
- No, no.

00:18:04.866 --> 00:18:06.607
No one touches my computer.

00:18:06.694 --> 00:18:08.522
Let her do her thing, Flowers.

00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:13.266
Okay, a little blurry.

00:18:13.353 --> 00:18:14.354
All right, zoom in.

00:18:14.441 --> 00:18:16.356
- Just--
- Ah, there we go!

00:18:16.443 --> 00:18:17.183
Ah, girl.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.881
What do we got?

00:18:19.968 --> 00:18:22.449
Okay, can you use this tech
to make us new identities?

00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:24.581
- Uh, fuck yeah.
- Yeah?

00:18:24.668 --> 00:18:26.801
But we're gonna need
some coffee.

00:18:26.888 --> 00:18:28.629
And food, too. I'm starvin'.

00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:29.673
I could eat.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.066
All right, Flowers.

00:18:31.153 --> 00:18:32.589
We need food, we need coffee.

00:18:32.676 --> 00:18:34.156
We gotta get to work.

00:18:34.243 --> 00:18:35.592
Thank you.

00:18:42.947 --> 00:18:45.167
All right, everyone.
Here's our new identities.

00:18:46.777 --> 00:18:48.257
What do we got?

00:18:48.344 --> 00:18:49.345
Whoa, cool!

00:18:49.432 --> 00:18:50.999
My name's Chico.

00:18:51.826 --> 00:18:53.436
Wait a minute.
Am I supposed to know Spanish?

00:18:53.523 --> 00:18:56.613
I-- I failed Spanish
in high school like three times.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.659
No, it was more like four times.

00:18:58.746 --> 00:19:00.269
But you don't have
to speak Spanish.

00:19:00.356 --> 00:19:02.271
But I'm tellin' y'all,
right now,

00:19:02.358 --> 00:19:04.621
you gotta know this shit
from cover to cover.

00:19:04.708 --> 00:19:06.014

00:19:34.303 --> 00:19:36.871
We're from Palo Alto,
California.

00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:40.483
I'm VC, specializing

So you know I go hard.
And I gamble the hardest.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.670
But at heart, loyalty
is what I live by.

00:19:53.757 --> 00:19:55.194
So let's get it.

00:19:56.456 --> 00:19:57.805
Hey, I'm Phil.

00:19:57.892 --> 00:19:59.589

Donovan Cage is a real person.

00:20:26.137 --> 00:20:27.574
Your cover could
easily be blown.

00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:29.445
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
This guy's different.

00:20:29.532 --> 00:20:31.230
He never wants
to be photographed.

00:20:31.317 --> 00:20:34.145
He's a-- a billionaire.
He likes to gamble.

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.017
This guy's a whale.

00:20:36.104 --> 00:20:37.714
They're gonna roll out
the red carpet for him

00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:39.020
in the casino.

00:20:39.107 --> 00:20:40.543
Thank you.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.154
He's got several corporations
all over the world.

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.418
He seldom leaves Asia.

00:20:45.505 --> 00:20:47.333
And he's gregarious.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.813
Now, no conservative bets.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.641
You think Salazar's up
for the big time?

00:20:51.728 --> 00:20:53.121
Of course.

00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:55.428
Okay, what's the marker?

00:20:55.515 --> 00:20:56.516
Sky's the limit.

00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:11.966
Mr. Cage.

00:21:12.053 --> 00:21:14.055
It's my pleasure to welcome you
to the Scarlet Pearl.

00:21:14.142 --> 00:21:15.926
I'm Bella, executive director
of the casino.

00:21:16.013 --> 00:21:18.059
Well, it's my pleasure, Bella.

00:21:18.146 --> 00:21:20.322
No need for mister,
Don is just fine.

00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:21.628
Quite a necklace you got there.

00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:22.585
Is that for real?

00:21:22.672 --> 00:21:24.239
Uh, only my jeweler and I know.

00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:27.634
You have a sense of humor.

00:21:27.721 --> 00:21:29.505
I was only just made aware
of your arrival,

00:21:29.592 --> 00:21:31.028
but I will do
everything in my power

00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:32.552
to make sure that your stay
is as perfect as possible.

00:21:32.639 --> 00:21:33.553
Oh, thank you.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.511
Also, the casino's owner

00:21:35.598 --> 00:21:37.470
regrets that he was not here
to personally greet you

00:21:37.557 --> 00:21:41.125
and thanks you for
your $10 million deposit.

00:21:41.212 --> 00:21:43.084
We've moved the guests
from our finest luxury suite

00:21:43.171 --> 00:21:44.781
so that you may have
our best accommodation.

00:21:44.868 --> 00:21:46.566
Oh, yeah, the penthouse.

00:21:46.653 --> 00:21:47.828
One floor below.

00:21:47.915 --> 00:21:49.960
The penthouse
is where Mr. Black lives.

00:21:50.047 --> 00:21:53.355
Oh, he doesn't want me to stay
in his house while I'm here?

00:21:53.442 --> 00:21:54.748
Just kidding.

00:21:54.835 --> 00:21:56.967
Floor below is just fine,
no worries.

00:21:57.054 --> 00:21:59.100
May I show you to your suite?

00:21:59.187 --> 00:22:01.755
No, I think I'm going to get
a lay of the land here,

00:22:01.842 --> 00:22:03.670
play a little cards.

00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:04.801
We have a private room for you,

00:22:04.888 --> 00:22:06.760
your own tables,
your choice of dealers.

00:22:06.847 --> 00:22:08.239
Nah, nah, nah.

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:09.763
I'm on vacation.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.853
I wanna rub elbows with
your most illustrious guests.

00:22:13.636 --> 00:22:14.811
As you wish.

00:22:15.943 --> 00:22:17.074
We're gonna be friends, Bella.

00:22:17.161 --> 00:22:19.425

If you're scared to play,
bet your money on Clay.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.643
Let's get it.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.861
Okay, we're gonna put
some money down here.

00:23:04.948 --> 00:23:05.949
We're gonna put some money here.

00:23:06.036 --> 00:23:07.734
We're gonna put
some money there.

00:23:07.821 --> 00:23:08.952
Let's go. Roll the ball.
Let's get it.

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:10.650
Let's go. Let's go.

00:23:13.696 --> 00:23:15.350
Seven!

00:23:18.484 --> 00:23:19.920
Yes, sir!

00:23:27.928 --> 00:23:28.711
All right.

00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:30.104
Let me get something on six.

00:23:31.322 --> 00:23:32.889
Something in the field.

00:23:32.976 --> 00:23:35.501
Let me get these dice for
this hot hand man right here.

00:23:38.939 --> 00:23:41.681
Ha!

00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:44.553
- Don.
- Clayton Gibson.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.426
You look familiar.
You ever been to Macau?

00:23:47.513 --> 00:23:49.732
Uh, not yet, but,
uh, it's on my list.

00:23:49.819 --> 00:23:51.865
Yeah, well, if you ever go,
I'd love to show you around.

00:23:51.952 --> 00:23:53.127
- Yo.
For the gentleman.

00:23:53.214 --> 00:23:54.302
I'ma hold you to that.

00:23:54.389 --> 00:23:56.435
- It's Don, right?
- Uh, Clayton, right?

00:23:56.522 --> 00:23:57.827
Yes, sir.

00:23:57.914 --> 00:23:59.873
Come on,
let me get these dice.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.309
- Let's get it.
- There you go.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.456
Donovan Cage.

00:24:17.543 --> 00:24:18.892
How do you like the view?

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.550
Are you monitoring me?

00:24:24.637 --> 00:24:27.248
Really keeping an eye
on Mr. Salazar's investment.

00:24:27.335 --> 00:24:29.598
Oh, well,
I'm up half a million crap,

00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:31.557
so, uh, I guess he owes me.

00:24:32.775 --> 00:24:34.211
I'm aware.

00:24:34.298 --> 00:24:35.822
You got a guy on the inside?

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:37.650
We have eyes
and ears everywhere.

00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:39.216
Have you met Zade Black?

00:24:39.303 --> 00:24:41.262
Not yet.

00:24:41.349 --> 00:24:45.745
Mr. Black and Mr. Salazar
are bitter enemies.

00:24:45.832 --> 00:24:49.009
If Zade finds out
who you're working for,

00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:51.402
you will not be arrested.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.623
Very likely,
you will die a slow,

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.060
excruciating death.

00:24:57.147 --> 00:24:58.235
Well, it sounds like
you're telling me

00:24:58.322 --> 00:24:59.498
to take care of myself.

00:24:59.585 --> 00:25:00.803
That's very sweet.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.675
I didn't know that you cared,
Mr. Flowers.

00:25:02.762 --> 00:25:04.894
You should start
taking this seriously, Mason.

00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:06.766
Take it seriously?

00:25:06.853 --> 00:25:08.768
I'm as serious
as a fucking heart attack.

00:25:17.124 --> 00:25:18.647
Dick.

00:25:34.445 --> 00:25:36.273
I understand
you enjoy champagne.

00:25:38.145 --> 00:25:39.276
Who doesn't?

00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:43.672
It's a matter of
mathematics and physics,
isn't it?

00:25:45.892 --> 00:25:49.112
The distance from
your hand to the knife?

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:55.728
Our entire lives are dictated
by the laws of time,

00:25:55.815 --> 00:25:57.468
space, and distance.

00:25:58.469 --> 00:25:59.906
Isn't that right, Amelia?

00:25:59.993 --> 00:26:01.298
Or should I call you Amy?

00:26:02.386 --> 00:26:05.389
Well,
only my friends call me Amy.

00:26:05.476 --> 00:26:07.261
Oh, maybe we'll end up friends.

00:26:07.348 --> 00:26:08.610
Stranger things
happen every day.

00:26:10.133 --> 00:26:14.311
Somehow I doubt
Abel Salazar has real friends.

00:26:14.398 --> 00:26:15.617
Hmm?

00:26:15.704 --> 00:26:17.793
You're still blinded
by the myopic worldview

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.361
the federal government burned
into your impressionable brain

00:26:20.448 --> 00:26:22.189
back in Quantico.

00:26:22.276 --> 00:26:23.930
I'm no boogeyman.

00:26:24.017 --> 00:26:25.366
I'm just a man.

00:26:25.453 --> 00:26:26.410
Okay.

00:26:26.497 --> 00:26:28.412
Whatever you say, Abel.

00:26:28.499 --> 00:26:32.416
According to the FBI,
Mason Goddard is evil as well.

00:26:32.503 --> 00:26:34.375
Taking what's not his,

00:26:34.462 --> 00:26:36.029
ignoring the law of man and God,

00:26:36.116 --> 00:26:37.726
breaking one of those
sacred commandments

00:26:37.813 --> 00:26:39.641
people live and die for.

00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:43.123
And yet,
you fell in love with him.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.126
Yeah, well, he is pretty cute.

00:26:46.213 --> 00:26:49.738
But listen, that's
false equivalency.

00:26:49.825 --> 00:26:51.566
Mason's never killed anyone.

00:26:51.653 --> 00:26:54.177
Nor have I. Hand to God.

00:26:56.136 --> 00:26:58.791
Listen, Abel,

00:26:58.878 --> 00:27:01.358
if we're goin' to be friends,
you probably shouldn't lie to me

00:27:01.445 --> 00:27:02.925
right off the bat.

00:27:03.012 --> 00:27:05.711
Okay, we'll call it semantics.
Yes?

00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:09.279
Because I know for a fact
at least a dozen people

00:27:09.366 --> 00:27:12.195
that you killed or--
or had killed.

00:27:12.282 --> 00:27:13.675
There you go.

00:27:13.762 --> 00:27:16.722
Ascribing super human powers
to me.

00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:18.985
If I could control
people like you suggest,

00:27:19.072 --> 00:27:21.204
I would still be a married man.

00:27:21.291 --> 00:27:22.989
What exactly happened there?

00:27:23.076 --> 00:27:24.294
Enough serious talk.

00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:27.036
Let's eat.

00:27:30.431 --> 00:27:32.041
Took me a little longer to hack

00:27:32.128 --> 00:27:36.219
into the security system
than I expected.

00:27:36.306 --> 00:27:39.092
Um, okay, guys,

00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:41.311
now we have complete control
of all the cameras.

00:27:41.398 --> 00:27:42.399
Good job, babe.

00:27:43.183 --> 00:27:45.315
- Are those live images?
- Yup.

00:27:45.402 --> 00:27:47.361
And I found the purchase order
for the safe.

00:27:47.448 --> 00:27:49.406
German. Burg Wachter,
custom made.

00:27:49.493 --> 00:27:50.712
Biometric.

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:52.975
Only opens up with the skin
on Zade's palm.

00:27:53.062 --> 00:27:55.195
Biometric? Fuck.

00:27:55.282 --> 00:27:56.805
It's not exactly my specialty.

00:27:58.285 --> 00:27:59.939
Excuse me.

00:28:01.244 --> 00:28:02.245
Si?

00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:04.987
Muy bien.

00:28:06.423 --> 00:28:08.512
You'll be happy to know
Mason is doing really well.

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:09.992
The assignment I have him on

00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:12.255
could even be seen
as a vacation of sorts.

00:28:12.342 --> 00:28:14.605
And who was that you
were speaking with?

00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.738
Oh, just someone I have
keeping an eye on him.

00:28:18.522 --> 00:28:19.785
Time.

00:28:19.872 --> 00:28:21.308
Space.

00:28:21.395 --> 00:28:22.439
Distance.

00:28:23.963 --> 00:28:25.486
I've never killed anyone.

00:28:26.661 --> 00:28:28.489
But you have,
haven't you, Amelia?

00:28:30.447 --> 00:28:33.973
What does it feel like
to take someone's life...

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.365
with your own hands?

00:28:37.541 --> 00:28:38.673
Mm.

00:28:39.195 --> 00:28:42.764
The safe is behind
that painting.

00:28:44.374 --> 00:28:46.159
Somewhere up there.

00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:47.726
- I'll go check.
- All right.

00:28:47.813 --> 00:28:48.770
Yeah.

00:28:49.945 --> 00:28:51.686
Try right ab--
right above the door.

00:29:00.042 --> 00:29:01.217
Ah, there you go.

00:29:02.001 --> 00:29:03.480
Keep goin'.

00:29:03.567 --> 00:29:05.613
Just do--
do a wider circle there.

00:29:07.658 --> 00:29:08.703
Nothin'.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.792
Right there. Try there.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.577
Okay.

00:29:14.709 --> 00:29:15.797
It's a lot of steel right there.

00:29:15.884 --> 00:29:17.451
So close.

00:29:17.538 --> 00:29:18.844
Yet so far.

00:29:20.367 --> 00:29:22.238
Where's Anton and Hector?

00:29:22.325 --> 00:29:23.892
No. They're on recon.

00:29:25.459 --> 00:29:26.721
We could just cut a hole
in the ceiling

00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:28.201
and drop that sucker down here.

00:29:28.288 --> 00:29:29.158
Oh, yeah.

00:29:29.245 --> 00:29:31.291
No one would notice that, Shawn.

00:29:31.378 --> 00:29:33.554
Hey, man. You know me.
I'm just riffin'.

00:29:33.641 --> 00:29:35.121
You're the boss.

00:29:35.208 --> 00:29:36.992
So?

00:29:37.079 --> 00:29:38.080
Boss?

00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:39.908
What's the plan?

00:29:40.604 --> 00:29:41.780
Hmm.

00:29:42.606 --> 00:29:44.826
Yeah. What's the plan?

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:46.828
Fuck.

00:29:56.925 --> 00:30:01.712
A lucky cat... gets nine lives.

00:30:03.627 --> 00:30:06.108
While the loyal dog
has to settle for one.

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.285
What kind of reward is that
for a creature

00:30:09.372 --> 00:30:11.679
known for such loyalty?

00:30:11.766 --> 00:30:13.550
Zade.

00:30:13.637 --> 00:30:16.031
Your men,
they got it all wrong.

00:30:16.118 --> 00:30:17.380
Fernando.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.643
My loyal dog.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:20.949
What have they done to you?

00:30:21.036 --> 00:30:21.994
What do you mean?

00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:23.473
What have they done?

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.474
They're keeping me responsible
for the lost shipment!

00:30:24.561 --> 00:30:26.259
Lost? No. No. No.

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:29.001
The shipment was stolen.

00:30:29.218 --> 00:30:31.394
No, I know it was stolen,
but it wasn't from me!

00:30:31.481 --> 00:30:33.266
Pa, please!

00:30:33.353 --> 00:30:34.833
I put that on my children!

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.009
On the soul of my wife!

00:30:37.096 --> 00:30:38.967
I'm right here, Fernando.

00:30:40.534 --> 00:30:44.843
Do you really care so little
for my eternal soul?

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:46.540
Zade...

00:30:48.934 --> 00:30:51.153
You know,
she doesn't know
what she's talkin' about.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.981
I don't-- I don't do business
with my wife, papi.

00:30:53.068 --> 00:30:53.982
You gotta believe me.

00:30:54.069 --> 00:30:55.462
Oh, you're full of shit!

00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:57.768
I told him everything!

00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.640
Everything.

00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:01.990
Oh, my God.

00:31:03.774 --> 00:31:05.864
Zade, please forgive me.

00:31:05.951 --> 00:31:07.256
No. No. No. No, no!

00:31:07.343 --> 00:31:08.692
Please! Please!

00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:10.303
I don't know what I was
thinkin' about, papi.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.565
I'm so sorry!

00:31:11.652 --> 00:31:12.653
I don't know what
I was thinking about.

00:31:14.046 --> 00:31:14.829
Please,
let me make this up to you!

00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:16.526
I'm so sorry!

00:31:16.613 --> 00:31:18.702
Why did you do that?

00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:20.269
My mind's not in a good place.

00:31:20.356 --> 00:31:22.402
Please,
you gotta forgive me.

00:31:22.489 --> 00:31:24.186
Please. No!

00:31:24.273 --> 00:31:25.187
Please.

00:31:29.278 --> 00:31:30.584
Let me out!

00:31:46.948 --> 00:31:48.994
Waste of a perfectly good cigar.

00:31:57.916 --> 00:31:59.918
You gaze at me in fear.

00:32:02.833 --> 00:32:04.879
That's wise, Adrianna.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.018
Go home to your children.

00:32:13.105 --> 00:32:14.584
Grieve this dog.

00:32:15.672 --> 00:32:17.239
When you're ready,

00:32:17.326 --> 00:32:19.328
we'll find a place for you
in the organization.

00:32:52.013 --> 00:32:53.145
I missed you.

00:32:53.232 --> 00:32:54.973
You better have, my darling.

00:33:18.126 --> 00:33:19.127
Here he comes.

00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:21.347
Play it cool, Chico.

00:33:21.434 --> 00:33:23.566
Remember, we're the most
important people in the room.

00:33:25.786 --> 00:33:28.441
Winner.

00:33:28.528 --> 00:33:29.746
Hell yeah.

00:33:30.965 --> 00:33:32.097
Mr. Cage.

00:33:33.011 --> 00:33:34.403
Bella!

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:35.970
Hey, what'd I tell you
about that mister stuff?

00:33:36.057 --> 00:33:37.667
Uh, yes. Don.

00:33:37.754 --> 00:33:40.409
I'm so excited to introduce you
to Mr. Black.

00:33:40.496 --> 00:33:41.497
How are you?

00:33:41.584 --> 00:33:44.022
Donovan Cage in my casino.

00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:44.935
It's an absolute honor.

00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:45.980
Oh, thank you.

00:33:46.067 --> 00:33:48.026
This is my right-hand man,
Chico.

00:33:48.113 --> 00:33:49.766
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

00:33:49.853 --> 00:33:51.377
What brings you to New Orleans?

00:33:52.552 --> 00:33:54.032
Change of pace.

00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:55.729
You know, a bit of a holiday.

00:33:55.816 --> 00:33:58.906
And, you know, Macau
has wealthy people.

00:33:58.993 --> 00:34:01.561
And the VIPs is so predictable.

00:34:01.648 --> 00:34:03.389
I just thought maybe I'd just
find a place

00:34:03.476 --> 00:34:04.390
that's a little earthier.

00:34:06.827 --> 00:34:08.176
That's the first time
my casino's been

00:34:08.263 --> 00:34:09.612
described that way.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:11.832
But I'm thrilled that
you're enjoying yourself.

00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:12.963
Well, thank you.

00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:14.139
Please accept my apologies

00:34:14.226 --> 00:34:15.662
I wasn't here to
personally welcome you.

00:34:15.749 --> 00:34:16.967
Oh, no. You're here now.

00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:18.926
That's all that matters.

00:34:19.013 --> 00:34:20.449
Would you like to join me
for a drink?

00:34:20.536 --> 00:34:21.755
I would love to join you
for a drink.

00:34:21.842 --> 00:34:23.409
- Excellent.
- Okay.

00:34:23.496 --> 00:34:24.932
I'll meet you soon.

00:34:25.019 --> 00:34:25.759
Right this way.

00:34:25.846 --> 00:34:27.065
Sure.

00:34:27.282 --> 00:34:28.979
I was surprised to hear
you declined the use

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.851
of one of our private
gaming rooms.

00:34:30.938 --> 00:34:32.766
Some of the biggest names in
the country have played there.

00:34:32.853 --> 00:34:34.202
Hmm.

00:34:34.289 --> 00:34:35.638
Well, honestly, Zade,

00:34:35.725 --> 00:34:38.293
unless it's one of
your epic poker games,

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.774
I think I'd rather be
on the floor with the people.

00:34:40.861 --> 00:34:42.515
Wow!

00:34:45.474 --> 00:34:47.085
You're making fast friends,
I see.

00:34:47.172 --> 00:34:48.912
Ah, well, I do okay.

00:34:50.697 --> 00:34:52.394
We have some of the most
gorgeous women in the world.

00:34:52.481 --> 00:34:54.353
Oh, I'm sure you do.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.486
If you need any introductions,
just say the word.

00:34:57.573 --> 00:35:01.621
Zade, are you telling me that I
can't find my own companionship?

00:35:02.535 --> 00:35:03.884
Mm-hmm?

00:35:03.971 --> 00:35:05.799
If I offended you, Don,
I'm-- I'm sorry.

00:35:05.886 --> 00:35:07.888
No worries. Here. A toast.

00:35:08.802 --> 00:35:10.586
Hmm.

00:35:10.673 --> 00:35:11.674
Yes.

00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:12.806
Hmm.

00:35:13.633 --> 00:35:16.244
Mm, you know,

00:35:16.331 --> 00:35:18.028
we have a mutual friend,
you and I.

00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:18.855
Who's that?

00:35:18.942 --> 00:35:20.074
Chaz.

00:35:21.858 --> 00:35:22.990
Chaz Antonelli.

00:35:23.904 --> 00:35:24.948
Chaz.

00:35:25.035 --> 00:35:25.906
He's a great guy.

00:35:25.993 --> 00:35:27.516
Good card player.

00:35:27.603 --> 00:35:28.909
Yeah.

00:35:28.996 --> 00:35:30.215
By the way,
you mentioned something

00:35:30.302 --> 00:35:32.695
about my epic poker games.

00:35:32.782 --> 00:35:34.175
Yes?

00:35:34.262 --> 00:35:36.177
Would you be interested
in joining us?

00:35:36.264 --> 00:35:37.178
Of course.

00:35:37.265 --> 00:35:38.179
I would be honored to host you.

00:35:38.266 --> 00:35:39.006
Yes. Yes.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.443
Well, good. I hear you're good.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:42.879
Uh, more than good.

00:35:42.966 --> 00:35:43.967
Uh-huh?

00:35:44.054 --> 00:35:45.795
Well, I'm not. I'm rusty.

00:35:45.882 --> 00:35:47.536
Well, I can't say that
I would go easy on you.

00:35:47.623 --> 00:35:48.842
It would be disrespectful.

00:35:48.929 --> 00:35:49.712
Of course.

00:35:49.799 --> 00:35:52.454
Well, I don't like to lose.

00:35:52.541 --> 00:35:53.890
Oh, neither do I.

00:35:54.848 --> 00:35:55.675
I fuckin' hate it, too.

00:35:57.851 --> 00:35:59.244
- Clayton!
- Hey, my man. Don.

00:35:59.331 --> 00:36:00.245
- Hey.
- We meet again.

00:36:00.332 --> 00:36:01.028
Hey,
what's your last name again?

00:36:01.115 --> 00:36:01.855
Gibson.

00:36:01.942 --> 00:36:02.986
- Gibson.
- Yes, sir.

00:36:03.073 --> 00:36:04.771
Zade,
you must know Clayton Gibson.

00:36:04.858 --> 00:36:06.120
Oh, I do now.

00:36:06.207 --> 00:36:07.208
Zade Black.

00:36:07.295 --> 00:36:08.688
Welcome to the Scarlet Pearl,
Clay.

00:36:08.775 --> 00:36:10.255
Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.

00:36:10.342 --> 00:36:11.778
You got yourself
a fine establishment here.

00:36:13.432 --> 00:36:15.434
I'm so pleased to see
you're makin' the most of it.

00:36:15.521 --> 00:36:17.697
Okay, so Zade
has strong-armed me

00:36:17.784 --> 00:36:18.828
into a poker game.

00:36:18.915 --> 00:36:20.003
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.309
I'm tryin' to do
the same thing.

00:36:21.396 --> 00:36:22.919
Oh, would you be interested

00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:24.617
in joining us
in a private game, Clay?

00:36:24.704 --> 00:36:25.444
Most definitely.

00:36:25.531 --> 00:36:26.793
Yes.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.404
Okay, well. Ah, Bella.

00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:31.493
I feel like I've missed
something significant.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.234
What are you boys scheming?

00:36:33.321 --> 00:36:35.802
We're talking about setting up
a private game of poker

00:36:35.889 --> 00:36:37.325
- in the penthouse.
- Oh.

00:36:37.412 --> 00:36:39.632
Well, I would be delighted
to make those arrangements.

00:36:39.719 --> 00:36:42.200
So long as I have
a seat at the table.

00:36:42.287 --> 00:36:43.549
You got game, too?

00:36:43.636 --> 00:36:45.159
She's almost as good as I am.

00:36:45.246 --> 00:36:46.508
Is that right?

00:36:46.595 --> 00:36:47.553
Tomorrow night, then?

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.815
Oh, okay,
if we're gonna do this,

00:36:48.902 --> 00:36:49.685
we gotta do it right.

00:36:49.772 --> 00:36:51.078
Big stakes.

00:36:51.165 --> 00:36:52.688
Absolutely.

00:36:52.775 --> 00:36:54.212
How high are we talking?

00:36:54.299 --> 00:36:55.865
That's up to you.

00:36:55.952 --> 00:36:57.998
Them the only stakes I play,
the big stakes.

00:36:58.085 --> 00:36:58.912
Oh, okay.

00:36:58.999 --> 00:37:00.435
The big. Let's get it.

00:37:12.186 --> 00:37:14.710
I love how you were
shittin' all over his casino.

00:37:14.797 --> 00:37:16.669
What did you call it? Earthy?

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.585
What was that about?

00:37:19.672 --> 00:37:22.152
Men like Zade,
they only respect power.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.242
And I had to remind him
that I have more of it.

00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:27.070
Thus, he wants to impress me.

00:37:27.157 --> 00:37:28.855
That dude's a slimeball.

00:37:28.942 --> 00:37:30.073
Seems kind of dangerous.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.553
I don't want you getting hurt.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.380
Ah, I'm not worried.

00:37:32.467 --> 00:37:33.642
I got good protection.

00:37:33.729 --> 00:37:35.209
- You do?
- Yeah.

00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:38.778
- Oh, you mean me?
- I'm-- I do.

00:37:38.865 --> 00:37:40.388
I'm countin' on you, Chico.

00:37:43.826 --> 00:37:46.002
- How's it going?
- Mm-hmm.

00:37:47.526 --> 00:37:48.918
Hey.

00:37:49.005 --> 00:37:51.573
How does a bank manager learn
how to dust prints?

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.966
I did my research.

00:37:53.053 --> 00:37:54.707
We had biometric tech
at the bank.

00:37:54.794 --> 00:37:55.534
Oh, yeah?

00:37:55.621 --> 00:37:56.665
Check this out.

00:37:57.797 --> 00:38:00.147
Whoa! Trippy.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:02.802
Do you have enough to work with?

00:38:02.889 --> 00:38:05.500
Uh, I think so.

00:38:05.587 --> 00:38:07.154
You think so?

00:38:07.241 --> 00:38:09.548
What, you want me to blow smoke
up your ass and say I'm sure?

00:38:09.635 --> 00:38:10.592
I'm not.

00:38:10.679 --> 00:38:11.941
This isn't exact science, guys.

00:38:12.899 --> 00:38:14.117
Fair enough.

00:38:14.204 --> 00:38:16.729
I'll scan this.

00:38:16.816 --> 00:38:19.558
And assemble a digital model
of Zade's right hand.

00:38:19.645 --> 00:38:21.037
And we'll run some tests
on the 3D printer.

00:38:21.124 --> 00:38:22.343
Oh, that thing's dope.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.736
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:39:04.864 --> 00:39:05.908
Richter.

00:39:05.995 --> 00:39:06.648
Spotted Hector.

00:39:06.735 --> 00:39:07.301
Where?

00:39:07.736 --> 00:39:08.302
Casino.

00:39:08.389 --> 00:39:09.738
You're shitting me.

00:39:09.825 --> 00:39:10.652
Might want to get over here.

00:39:10.739 --> 00:39:11.653
Yeah, copy that.

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:14.177
What's up, man?

00:39:14.264 --> 00:39:15.483
Change of plans.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.224
One of our informants
spotted Hector Flores

00:39:17.311 --> 00:39:19.313
at the Scarlet Pearl Casino
in New Orleans.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.619
You know who owns that place?

00:39:20.706 --> 00:39:21.750
No, who?

00:39:21.837 --> 00:39:23.535
Zade Black.

00:39:23.622 --> 00:39:25.188
Are they there
with the whole crew?

00:39:25.275 --> 00:39:26.102
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:39:26.189 --> 00:39:29.236
This guy Black is bad news.

00:39:29.323 --> 00:39:31.499
They better not
get on his bad side,

00:39:31.586 --> 00:39:33.501
or it won't be much left of them
for us to arrest.

00:40:06.969 --> 00:40:08.971
Oh, shit.

00:40:09.058 --> 00:40:10.451
Oh!

00:40:10.538 --> 00:40:11.887
So how's it goin'?

00:40:11.974 --> 00:40:13.149
Oh, we're set to go.

00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:14.368
Surprise is good.

00:40:14.455 --> 00:40:15.413
Mm-hmm.

00:40:16.588 --> 00:40:17.980
You get some rest, boss?

00:40:19.025 --> 00:40:20.592
Oh, you know me.
I don't need rest.

00:40:20.679 --> 00:40:21.941
Hello?

00:40:22.028 --> 00:40:23.246
Who is this?

00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:24.944
This is Donovan Cage.

00:40:25.031 --> 00:40:26.380
Hello, Mason.

00:40:29.557 --> 00:40:32.255
Uh, you got the wrong number, friend.

00:40:32.342 --> 00:40:36.042
We're both on secure phones,
so no need for subterfuge.

00:40:36.129 --> 00:40:39.262
And most definitely,
I'm not your friend.

00:40:43.876 --> 00:40:45.573
Salazar?

00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:48.750
I understand you intend
to access the safe tonight.

00:40:48.837 --> 00:40:50.970
Yes, but, uh,

00:40:51.057 --> 00:40:54.582
don't you think it's time to
tell us what we're looking for?

00:40:54.669 --> 00:40:56.802
I will tell you
when you open it.

00:40:56.889 --> 00:40:58.586
Well, why all the secrecy?

00:40:58.673 --> 00:41:00.849
What, does Zade have your soul
locked up or something?

00:41:02.242 --> 00:41:04.244
Oh, that's rather amusing.

00:41:04.331 --> 00:41:07.769
I see that your reputation
as an international fugitive

00:41:07.856 --> 00:41:09.684
is very well earned.

00:41:09.771 --> 00:41:12.208
Well, you got me curious, boss.

00:41:12.295 --> 00:41:15.385
I mean, when I open this safe,

00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:17.997
how are you goin'
to tell us what to steal?

00:41:18.084 --> 00:41:19.999
I'll be watchingeverything.

00:41:20.086 --> 00:41:23.089
Amongst all that nifty gadgetry
Mr. Flowers had delivered to

00:41:23.176 --> 00:41:24.786
your suite,

00:41:24.873 --> 00:41:28.964
there's a new comm system,
complete with tiny cameras.

00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:30.705
Link will love them.

00:41:30.792 --> 00:41:32.228
And what if I--
What if I told you that

00:41:32.315 --> 00:41:34.753
I don't-- I don't want to
and I can't work

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.755
with someone breathing down
my neck

00:41:36.842 --> 00:41:38.234
and watching my every move?

00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:41.150
Then I will tell you,
you will never see Decker again.

00:41:41.237 --> 00:41:42.848
Put her on the phone.

00:41:42.935 --> 00:41:44.197
I can't risk distracting you.

00:41:44.284 --> 00:41:45.154
Do it!

00:41:45.241 --> 00:41:46.765
The finest boxers in the world

00:41:46.852 --> 00:41:49.028
never get to talk
to their woman before a fight.

00:41:49.115 --> 00:41:50.595
I am notasking you,

00:41:50.682 --> 00:41:53.206
I'm telling you,
put her on the fuckin' phone!

00:41:53.293 --> 00:41:57.253
I happen to have met
the real Donovan Cage.

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.385
Small world.

00:42:01.214 --> 00:42:04.304
The poker game
was a clever move.

00:42:04.391 --> 00:42:05.566
But dangerous.

00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:12.051
My brother thinks very highly
of his poker skills.

00:42:12.138 --> 00:42:13.487
But he's a sore loser.

00:42:13.574 --> 00:42:15.184
W-- w-- wait-- wait a minute.

00:42:15.271 --> 00:42:17.622
Losing can make him violent.

00:42:17.709 --> 00:42:19.754
Are you--
are you telling me that--

00:42:19.841 --> 00:42:22.844
That Zade Black
is your brother?

00:42:22.931 --> 00:42:24.716
Mr. Flowers didn't mention that?

00:42:24.803 --> 00:42:26.761
No, no, he didn't mention that

00:42:26.848 --> 00:42:29.851
we're goin' to be in the middle
of a deadly family feud.

00:42:29.938 --> 00:42:32.158
He didn't.

00:42:32.245 --> 00:42:35.509
Looking forward to
tonight's festivities, Mason.

00:42:35.596 --> 00:42:37.424

Nice work, everyone.

Stay focused.

00:43:53.413 --> 00:43:55.415
Tonight,
anything less than perfection

00:43:55.502 --> 00:43:57.025
is unacceptable.

00:43:57.112 --> 00:43:59.201
Human perfection is impossible.

00:43:59.288 --> 00:44:00.812
Ruben.

00:44:00.899 --> 00:44:01.639
What are you doing here?

00:44:01.726 --> 00:44:03.205
I'm so sorry, Bella.

00:44:03.292 --> 00:44:04.729
I have a family emergency.

00:44:04.816 --> 00:44:06.861
I'll come back to get him
as soon as I can.

00:44:06.948 --> 00:44:08.820
Don't worry. I know the drill.

00:44:08.907 --> 00:44:10.560
I'll stay out of everyone's way.

00:44:11.474 --> 00:44:12.954
I know you will, sweetheart.

00:44:32.017 --> 00:44:33.540
Hello.

00:44:35.977 --> 00:44:37.370
Bingo.

00:44:42.027 --> 00:44:44.029
Oh, hi.

00:44:49.251 --> 00:44:50.470
Okay, what do you think?

00:44:50.557 --> 00:44:51.863
Look good to me.

00:44:56.519 --> 00:44:57.782
What's going on?

00:44:57.869 --> 00:44:59.305
There is a second safe.

00:45:00.741 --> 00:45:02.177
- A second safe?
- Yeah.

00:45:02.264 --> 00:45:03.222
In the penthouse?

00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:04.440
George found it.

00:45:04.527 --> 00:45:06.312
In the staff bedroom
down the hallway.

00:45:06.399 --> 00:45:07.705
Behind that painting.

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:09.271
Shit.

00:45:09.358 --> 00:45:10.925
On the bright side,
I did a search

00:45:11.012 --> 00:45:12.100
and found the purchase order.

00:45:12.187 --> 00:45:13.754
Same custom model.

00:45:13.841 --> 00:45:16.278
He probably has it programmed
to open with the same palm scan

00:45:16.365 --> 00:45:17.410
like the other one.

00:45:17.497 --> 00:45:18.628
Probably.

00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:20.021
Fuck me.

00:45:20.108 --> 00:45:22.589
Yeah, my point exactly, man.

00:45:22.676 --> 00:45:24.286
So what? What do we do, huh?

00:45:26.158 --> 00:45:26.941
How do we look?

00:45:27.028 --> 00:45:28.116
- Yo.

00:45:28.203 --> 00:45:29.552
Ooh!

00:45:30.858 --> 00:45:32.251
Oh, shit.

00:45:32.338 --> 00:45:33.382
What happened now?

00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:36.255
Okay, worst case,
we check both safes.

00:45:36.342 --> 00:45:37.952
And we use the same glove,
right, for both?

00:45:38.039 --> 00:45:39.388
I mean,
that's even if it works, man.

00:45:39.475 --> 00:45:40.259
I mean, honestly.

00:45:40.346 --> 00:45:41.956
Not helpful, Hector.

00:45:42.043 --> 00:45:43.741
Somebody gonna tell us
what's goin' on?

00:45:43.828 --> 00:45:45.046
What do you mean both safes?

00:45:45.133 --> 00:45:46.004
Okay, Link.

00:45:46.091 --> 00:45:47.701
- Hello?
- Any ideas?

00:45:49.094 --> 00:45:50.704
I think the best move

00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:53.663
is to access them both
at the exact same time.

00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:55.056
Yeah, she's right.

00:45:55.143 --> 00:45:57.711
We either hit both safes
simultaneously or pick one.

00:45:59.017 --> 00:46:00.279
We're makin' another glove.

00:46:00.366 --> 00:46:02.020
But it's just not gonna
be ready in time.

00:46:02.107 --> 00:46:04.370
We already have two gloves.

00:46:04.457 --> 00:46:06.328
No, one's already out
of commission.

00:46:06.415 --> 00:46:07.547
How?

00:46:08.678 --> 00:46:10.071
It has started to disintegrate.

00:46:11.029 --> 00:46:12.726
Oh, my God.

00:46:12.813 --> 00:46:14.032
Okay.

00:46:14.119 --> 00:46:16.338
How long does it take
to make a second glove?

00:46:16.425 --> 00:46:17.557
About an hour.

00:46:18.427 --> 00:46:19.602
That's cool.

00:46:19.689 --> 00:46:20.995
Let's-- let's do it.

00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:23.345
All right.
Well, it's time to go, right?

00:46:23.432 --> 00:46:24.869
Yes, it is, Chico.

00:46:24.956 --> 00:46:26.522
Check your camera.

00:46:26.609 --> 00:46:27.828
Cameras are a go.

00:46:27.915 --> 00:46:29.482
Ear pieces in.

00:46:33.834 --> 00:46:36.794
Okay, so what's the plan?

00:46:36.881 --> 00:46:38.839
The plan is to play some jazz, brother.

00:46:38.926 --> 00:46:39.927
Let's get it.

00:46:40.014 --> 00:46:41.189
It's showtime.

00:46:41.276 --> 00:46:42.495
Jazz?

00:46:42.582 --> 00:46:43.931
Yeah, jazz.

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:28.758
Zade!

00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.151
Oh, there he is.

00:47:30.238 --> 00:47:31.239
How are you?

00:47:31.326 --> 00:47:32.197
- Welcome, my friend.
- Uh, thank you.

00:47:32.284 --> 00:47:33.415
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

00:47:33.502 --> 00:47:35.113
No doubt about it.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.592
This is the place
that I should be staying.

00:47:37.593 --> 00:47:38.681
This guy is such a ballbuster.

00:47:38.768 --> 00:47:39.900
Clayton!

00:47:40.727 --> 00:47:42.120
- Yes, sir.
- How you doin'?

00:47:42.207 --> 00:47:43.991
- You ready to lose some money?
- Oh, yeah.

00:47:44.078 --> 00:47:46.080
Gonna call this Clay G's Casino
when I'm done.

00:47:47.429 --> 00:47:48.604
- He's feisty tonight!
- Yes, sir.

00:47:48.691 --> 00:47:49.779
- Get ready, everybody.
- My house.

00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:51.477
And don't you look dashing
tonight.

00:47:51.564 --> 00:47:52.478
And you--

00:47:52.565 --> 00:47:53.914
My dear, look stunning.

00:47:54.001 --> 00:47:54.915
I love that dress.

00:47:55.002 --> 00:47:55.916
Thank you.

00:47:56.917 --> 00:47:57.657
Who's this?

00:47:57.744 --> 00:47:58.701
Uh...

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.313
So, I hear you're a billionaire.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.968
This is my nephew Ruben.

00:48:04.055 --> 00:48:05.404
He's very precocious.

00:48:05.491 --> 00:48:07.710
Well, I'm Don,
and yes, you are correct.

00:48:08.537 --> 00:48:09.669
I wanna be a trillionaire.

00:48:10.757 --> 00:48:11.932
I believe you.

00:48:12.019 --> 00:48:14.021
Maybe one day I'll--
I'll ask you for a loan.

00:48:14.108 --> 00:48:15.588
I charge interest.

00:48:15.675 --> 00:48:16.894
Smart boy.

00:48:16.981 --> 00:48:18.069
Yeah.

00:48:18.156 --> 00:48:20.419
Don, you have to try the shrimp.

00:48:20.506 --> 00:48:22.551
Today's fresh catch
right off my boat.

00:48:22.638 --> 00:48:23.770
And the drinks are being made

00:48:23.857 --> 00:48:25.598
by the finest mixologist
in the South.

00:48:25.685 --> 00:48:26.860
Oh, you're tryin'
to get me drunk

00:48:26.947 --> 00:48:27.774
to get all my money.

00:48:27.861 --> 00:48:29.167
Is that what he's trying to do?

00:48:29.254 --> 00:48:30.908
I don't need
any unfair advantages

00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:32.561
to take all your money, Don.

00:48:32.648 --> 00:48:34.824
God has gifted me with
that elusive combination

00:48:34.912 --> 00:48:36.043
of luck and talent.

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.044
Ah, very good.

00:48:37.131 --> 00:48:39.699
Well, back to the drinks then.

00:48:39.786 --> 00:48:41.135
Be creative.
What do you want to drink?

00:48:41.222 --> 00:48:42.920
We've got the best bartender
in the world here.

00:48:44.182 --> 00:48:45.096
A beer.

00:48:46.097 --> 00:48:47.011
Huh.

00:48:48.142 --> 00:48:50.231
You're hilarious, Chico.

00:48:50.318 --> 00:48:52.364
Uh, gin martini for me
would be great.

00:48:53.104 --> 00:48:54.322
I like beer.

00:49:01.808 --> 00:49:03.636
Welcome to New Orleans,
Mr. Antonelli.

00:49:03.723 --> 00:49:05.159
I'm Tanya.

00:49:06.726 --> 00:49:08.293
They didn't tell me
how cute you are.

00:49:10.164 --> 00:49:13.776
You are a sweetheart, Tanya.

00:49:13.863 --> 00:49:15.126
I've been instructed
to take you directly

00:49:15.213 --> 00:49:17.650
to Mr. Black's penthouse
at the Scarlet Pearl.

00:49:17.737 --> 00:49:20.218
I heard Donovan Cage is there?

00:49:20.305 --> 00:49:21.088
Yes, sir.

00:49:21.175 --> 00:49:22.437
He can't wait to see you.

00:49:22.524 --> 00:49:23.743
Then what are we waiting for?

00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:45.547
Here you go, babe.

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.637
Okay.

00:49:48.724 --> 00:49:50.900
Time to loop in, Dr. Evil.

00:49:53.947 --> 00:49:54.774
Testing.

00:49:54.861 --> 00:49:57.168
One, two, three.

00:49:58.256 --> 00:50:00.432
Mr. Salazar,
can you hear me?

00:50:00.519 --> 00:50:01.911
Good evening, Link.

00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:03.826
How are you?

00:50:03.913 --> 00:50:06.699
Um, a little pissed
you fucked up my wedding day.

00:50:07.526 --> 00:50:09.310
Marriage as an institution
is a bigger failure

00:50:09.397 --> 00:50:10.964
than the modern banking system.

00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:12.574
I did you a favor.

00:50:12.661 --> 00:50:15.751
But I had the cutest dress.

00:50:15.838 --> 00:50:18.493
Anyway, you can monitor
tonight's proceedings

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:20.104
via the hidden cameras.

00:50:20.191 --> 00:50:22.019
Our boys will be able
to hear you

00:50:22.106 --> 00:50:23.498
should you wish
to cheer them on.

00:50:23.585 --> 00:50:24.978
So grab some popcorn

00:50:25.065 --> 00:50:27.372
and let's hope this doesn't
turn into a snuff film.

00:50:28.721 --> 00:50:31.202
I know you're joking,

00:50:31.289 --> 00:50:33.291
but in addition to
being the shrimp king,

00:50:33.378 --> 00:50:35.249
Zade happens to own
the largest collection

00:50:35.336 --> 00:50:37.338
of authentic snuff films
in the world.

00:50:38.818 --> 00:50:40.341
Good to know.

00:50:40.428 --> 00:50:43.823
Um, give me a shout if you
encounter any technical issues.

00:51:26.431 --> 00:51:28.259
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:51:28.346 --> 00:51:30.217
Don, here to my right.

00:51:30.304 --> 00:51:32.306
- Oh.
- Chico and Clay.

00:51:32.393 --> 00:51:33.655
- And this is your seat?
- Yes.

00:51:33.742 --> 00:51:36.658
- Ah, to my left, really?
- Hmm.

00:51:36.745 --> 00:51:37.529
Okay.

00:51:38.921 --> 00:51:40.923
Lucy, I'm so glad
you could join us.

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:43.143
You know I never miss a chance
to shake down your rich friends.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:44.884
Gentlemen.

00:51:44.971 --> 00:51:45.754
- Cheers.
- Wonderful.

00:51:45.841 --> 00:51:47.278
- Cheers.
- Wonderful.

00:51:47.365 --> 00:51:49.236
Escort him directly
up to the penthouse.

00:51:53.501 --> 00:51:54.633
I have a surprise for you, Don.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.069
Is that right?

00:51:56.156 --> 00:51:57.766
Our mutual friend,
Chaz Antonelli,

00:51:57.853 --> 00:51:59.159
has touched down in New Orleans.

00:51:59.246 --> 00:52:00.813
He'll be joining us shortly.

00:52:02.945 --> 00:52:04.469
- Chaz? He's-- he's here?
- Mm-hmm.

00:52:04.556 --> 00:52:06.253
Yeah, he was very excited
to know that you were here.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.559
Oh, my goodness. Wow!

00:52:07.646 --> 00:52:09.038
Wonderful.

00:52:09.126 --> 00:52:11.650
Well, uh, I hope you have
some lovely ladies on hand.

00:52:11.737 --> 00:52:13.347
Of course.
I'm the consummate wingman.

00:52:13.434 --> 00:52:14.174
I know you are.

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:18.874
The minimum, as you know,
is $1 million to start.

00:52:18.961 --> 00:52:19.745
Okay.

00:52:19.832 --> 00:52:21.225
May the best person win.

00:52:21.312 --> 00:52:22.095
Let's begin.

00:52:22.182 --> 00:52:23.227
Let's do this.

00:52:30.756 --> 00:52:32.453
I do need popcorn.

00:52:33.933 --> 00:52:36.631
This evening just got
much more interesting.

00:52:36.718 --> 00:52:37.806
Don't worry, Mason.

00:52:37.893 --> 00:52:39.068
In all our spare time,

00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:41.288
we'll try to monitor
Antonelli's location.

00:52:41.375 --> 00:52:42.594
How's our glove?

00:52:42.681 --> 00:52:43.682
Almost ready.

00:52:43.769 --> 00:52:45.858
You need to get changed.

00:52:45.945 --> 00:52:47.120
Into what?

00:52:56.825 --> 00:52:58.000
Raise.

00:52:59.176 --> 00:53:01.308
Raise, 200k.

00:53:04.964 --> 00:53:06.748
I raise 300,000.

00:53:09.795 --> 00:53:10.926
I call.

00:53:13.668 --> 00:53:16.497
I raise 500,000.

00:53:17.629 --> 00:53:19.239
I call.

00:53:19.326 --> 00:53:20.632
I have a straight.

00:53:34.341 --> 00:53:36.300
I raise 100,000.

00:53:37.562 --> 00:53:38.606
All in.

00:53:42.697 --> 00:53:44.525
Raise?

00:53:44.612 --> 00:53:45.874
I don't believe you.

00:53:45.961 --> 00:53:46.919
I call.

00:53:54.361 --> 00:53:55.144
All in.

00:54:05.285 --> 00:54:06.852
You know what, Zade?

00:54:06.939 --> 00:54:08.245
I raise half a million.

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.249
I call.

00:54:26.306 --> 00:54:28.352
Only thing I'm foldin'
is the money, baby.

00:54:28.439 --> 00:54:29.527
I'm all in.

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:38.492
I raise 100,000.

00:54:39.885 --> 00:54:41.365
I raise 300,000.

00:54:43.323 --> 00:54:45.282
I call 300,000.

00:54:46.805 --> 00:54:48.633
Ah, fuck, man.

00:54:52.114 --> 00:54:53.246
I'm all in.

00:54:56.249 --> 00:54:57.772
I fold.

00:55:00.122 --> 00:55:01.385
I fold.

00:55:04.953 --> 00:55:07.391
So how you two meet?

00:55:07.478 --> 00:55:09.131
It's actually quite scandalous.

00:55:09.218 --> 00:55:10.437
I was in a relationship

00:55:10.524 --> 00:55:12.439
with someone that
Zade knows quite well.

00:55:15.094 --> 00:55:16.051
How well?

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.142
Well, I didn't think

00:55:20.229 --> 00:55:24.103
I would be showing my cards
so early in the evening,

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:26.627
but since we're all friends,
I'll be frank.

00:55:27.933 --> 00:55:30.718
Bella was in a relationship
with my brother.

00:55:30.805 --> 00:55:31.676
Damn!

00:55:31.763 --> 00:55:33.025
Been there, done that, honey.

00:55:34.983 --> 00:55:36.507
Um, what happened?

00:55:37.812 --> 00:55:39.814
He didn't deserve her,
so I took her.

00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:41.033
Simple as that.

00:55:42.295 --> 00:55:43.514
That's cold.

00:55:43.601 --> 00:55:46.299
Maybe I took you, dear.

00:55:46.386 --> 00:55:50.347
The bottom line is
he lost and I won.

00:55:52.479 --> 00:55:54.046
God damn it.

00:55:54.133 --> 00:55:56.744
You better get to that safe
before I call an airstrike

00:55:56.831 --> 00:55:58.659
and level that entire casino!

00:55:59.965 --> 00:56:01.096
Fuck!

00:56:04.578 --> 00:56:07.102
Um, cheers to you.

00:56:07.189 --> 00:56:08.190
And to you.

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:15.372
Don, you have
an executive assistant,

00:56:15.459 --> 00:56:18.984
- Ms. Connors?
- Yes.

00:56:19.071 --> 00:56:20.942
Um, unfortunately,
she's barely competent,

00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:23.684
- but, uh...
- She's requested a word.

00:56:25.947 --> 00:56:27.514
Send the buzzkill in, please.

00:56:36.131 --> 00:56:37.394
Chico can handle it.

00:56:41.833 --> 00:56:42.747
I'll handle it.

00:56:42.834 --> 00:56:44.096
No more interruptions.

00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:00.373
Ah, of course
he's fucking cheating.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:01.505
For fuck's sake.

00:57:01.592 --> 00:57:03.420
Zade, when are you
ever gonna grow up?

00:57:06.597 --> 00:57:07.728
I'm all in.

00:57:13.299 --> 00:57:14.605
I'm out.

00:57:14.692 --> 00:57:15.997
Me, too.

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:19.653
You got it.

00:57:20.306 --> 00:57:22.047
I'm afraid I am, too, babe.

00:57:26.486 --> 00:57:27.835
All in.

00:57:33.014 --> 00:57:34.842
Flush.

00:57:34.929 --> 00:57:36.061
Well played.

00:57:36.148 --> 00:57:36.931
Bravo, Zade.

00:57:37.018 --> 00:57:38.716
Well played, indeed.

00:57:38.803 --> 00:57:40.805
You knew that little
fucker's got something hot,

00:57:40.892 --> 00:57:43.285
and yet you throw my money away.

00:57:43.372 --> 00:57:44.939
All part of the plan, Salazar.

00:57:45.026 --> 00:57:48.377
Mason's keeping your brother
smug and off guard.

00:57:48.465 --> 00:57:50.510
God damn it, Mason.

00:57:50.597 --> 00:57:51.990
What's Antonelli's status, babe?

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.733
Yeah, less than five minutes
out.

00:57:59.388 --> 00:58:00.738
He's got a security tail.

00:58:00.825 --> 00:58:02.087
I don't think
I can make a move.

00:58:04.698 --> 00:58:06.352
We're running out of time.

00:58:16.928 --> 00:58:19.234
ETA, Hector?

00:58:19.321 --> 00:58:20.758
All right,
we're good to go here.

00:58:22.411 --> 00:58:24.588
It's now or never, Mason.

00:58:26.459 --> 00:58:28.200
Excuse me a moment, please.

00:58:33.422 --> 00:58:35.163
Hector, light him up.

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:36.861
All right, let's do it.

00:58:58.143 --> 00:58:59.753
This is my kind of poker game.

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:01.538
Y'all do fireworks here, too?

00:59:03.017 --> 00:59:04.845
Me, too. I love fireworks.

00:59:04.932 --> 00:59:06.760
This is a lovely surprise, darling.

00:59:06.847 --> 00:59:08.196
Anything for you, my dear.

00:59:09.197 --> 00:59:11.852
Ruben, come watch the fireworks.

00:59:11.939 --> 00:59:13.158
I'm busy, Mom!

00:59:14.463 --> 00:59:15.247
Spread the wealth, Link.

00:59:16.814 --> 00:59:20.644
This algorithm is gonna
make some folks very happy.

00:59:24.909 --> 00:59:25.997
Jackpot.

00:59:32.656 --> 00:59:33.918
I won! I won!

00:59:38.923 --> 00:59:41.795
Looping security cam's footage
in the bedrooms...

00:59:41.882 --> 00:59:42.840
...now.

01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:18.440
The safe will be hidden,
under a desk,

01:00:18.527 --> 01:00:20.573
behind a picture or a mirror.

01:00:24.925 --> 01:00:27.101
Now that looks promising, Mason.

01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:29.800
There should be a small lever
on the side

01:00:29.887 --> 01:00:32.150
or at the bottom
behind the frame.

01:00:32.237 --> 01:00:33.891
Check the bedroom, Shawn.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:51.735
I'm in.

01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:00.395
Bingo, Mason.

01:01:11.842 --> 01:01:15.193
Look for a small lever, Shawn.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.847
Can't find the lever.

01:01:16.934 --> 01:01:18.849
Are you a fuckin' idiot, Shawn.

01:01:18.936 --> 01:01:20.285
Not nice, Salazar.

01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:21.765
You got this, Shawn.

01:01:22.461 --> 01:01:24.419
Other-- other side of the frame,
Shawn.

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:32.079
Oh, you got it, Shawn.

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:35.300
The gloves are delicate.

01:01:35.387 --> 01:01:36.780
Be careful.

01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:40.000
We need all the fingers
and the palms intact.

01:01:48.966 --> 01:01:50.358
You guys ready?

01:01:52.447 --> 01:01:54.145
We've been hacked.
Shut down the slot.

01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:55.363
Contain whoever was
playing the machines

01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:56.669
with the payouts.

01:02:01.413 --> 01:02:02.980
We found the source
of the fireworks.

01:02:03.067 --> 01:02:04.242
It's a pickup truck.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.682
No one's here, though.

01:02:22.956 --> 01:02:24.001
They're headin' up.

01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:31.008
You guys ready?

01:02:31.095 --> 01:02:32.226
Ready.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.576
Ready.

01:02:34.663 --> 01:02:38.972
Remember, it needs to be
at the exact same time.

01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:41.453
Press your palms gently
against the sensor

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.716
on my go.

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:45.283
Three.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.024
Two.

01:02:47.111 --> 01:02:49.069
One.

01:02:49.156 --> 01:02:50.070
Go.

01:02:52.899 --> 01:02:54.858
Ah, got it.

01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:57.469
Huh!

01:02:59.297 --> 01:03:00.385
Okay, time to spill.

01:03:00.472 --> 01:03:01.603
What are we looking for?

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:03.431
Take all the hard drives.

01:03:04.911 --> 01:03:06.086
All hard drives.

01:03:06.173 --> 01:03:07.784
Okay. We got cash.

01:03:09.611 --> 01:03:12.136
We got paperwork.

01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:13.441
Nothin' in there.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.836
Got jewelry.

01:03:16.923 --> 01:03:18.969
Jewelry box.

01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:20.709
Hard drives come in all shapes
and sizes.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.146
They could be hidden.

01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:23.277
Nothin' in the lining.

01:03:23.364 --> 01:03:24.452
You guys have to hurry.

01:03:31.895 --> 01:03:32.896
I don't see any hard drive.

01:03:32.983 --> 01:03:34.419
It must be in there!
Keep looking!

01:03:34.506 --> 01:03:36.464
No, I'm lookin', man.

01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:37.596
It's a bust for me, too.

01:03:37.683 --> 01:03:39.728
It's just jewelry and cash.

01:04:05.363 --> 01:04:06.799
Wait, hold on.

01:04:06.886 --> 01:04:09.149
What? Wh-- what is it?

01:04:11.673 --> 01:04:13.458
No! No!

01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:15.460
No fuckin' way!

01:04:37.134 --> 01:04:38.135
Huh.

01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:43.749
Found a hard drive.

01:04:43.836 --> 01:04:46.056
Shawn, get out of there,

01:04:46.143 --> 01:04:47.057
now!

01:05:13.866 --> 01:05:14.954
Ruben!

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:15.955
Hey, kiddo.

01:05:16.042 --> 01:05:17.391
Come on.

01:05:17.478 --> 01:05:18.827
Let's go get you
a cheeseburger.

01:05:27.662 --> 01:05:29.838
So, what did I miss?

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:31.144
Just some goddamn fireworks.

01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:31.971
Oh, yeah?

01:05:32.058 --> 01:05:33.233
Uh, just my luck.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.060
No worries.

01:05:34.147 --> 01:05:35.757
Chaz is on his way up.

01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:37.281
Great.

01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:40.110
Now, Zade, hasn't gotten
cold feet or something, has he?

01:05:40.197 --> 01:05:42.286
Uh, just attending to some
casino business.

01:05:42.373 --> 01:05:43.330
So, he'll be here soon.

01:05:43.417 --> 01:05:44.462
Oh, problem?

01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:45.985
Uh, no.

01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:49.293
Bartender,
can I get another beer, please?

01:05:50.337 --> 01:05:52.252
You know how much
I'm paying this bartender.

01:05:52.339 --> 01:05:54.124
I would think you'd be
a little more adventurous.

01:05:55.081 --> 01:05:56.082
All right.

01:05:56.169 --> 01:05:58.563
Mm, what do you suggest,
Bella?

01:05:58.650 --> 01:06:01.914
Mm, Cuba libre?

01:06:03.437 --> 01:06:04.873
Okay.

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.919
Cuba libre, please?

01:06:08.834 --> 01:06:10.575
No idea if this is gonna work.

01:06:29.855 --> 01:06:31.204
Okay. I'll be right there.

01:06:32.205 --> 01:06:33.467
Everything okay?

01:06:34.816 --> 01:06:37.994
Um, it appears Chaz
is stuck in the elevator.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:40.605
Ugh. Really?

01:06:40.692 --> 01:06:42.781
Oh, no.
Chaz is not gonna like that.

01:06:42.868 --> 01:06:44.043
Minor hiccup.

01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:46.698
Well, take your time.

01:06:46.785 --> 01:06:49.222
We'll make sure you get your
money's worth out of the bar.

01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:51.181
Make 'em stronger this time.

01:06:51.268 --> 01:06:52.182
Enjoy, gentlemen.

01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:53.661
Zade and I will
be back shortly.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:06:59.319
Okay. We got it.

01:06:59.406 --> 01:07:01.147
Casino security got Hector.

01:07:01.234 --> 01:07:02.757
Oh, shit.

01:07:04.107 --> 01:07:05.804
Excuse me, ladies.

01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:07.327
I'm gonna be right back.

01:07:07.414 --> 01:07:08.676
Y'all stay put now.

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:13.594
We'll get him back.

01:07:13.681 --> 01:07:14.552
How?

01:07:14.639 --> 01:07:15.988
Just one thing at a time.

01:07:16.075 --> 01:07:17.598
Come on. Hard drive.

01:07:17.685 --> 01:07:19.383
- Let's do it.
- Okay. Fuck.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:25.476
Okay, let's see
what Dr. Evil is so hot for.

01:07:30.263 --> 01:07:32.352
Looks like a blockchain wallet.

01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:33.701
Uh-huh.

01:07:35.877 --> 01:07:37.096
Oh, my God.

01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:40.665
This is it.

01:07:40.752 --> 01:07:41.666
This is it.

01:07:41.753 --> 01:07:43.624
What is it? What's it?

01:07:43.711 --> 01:07:45.278
You remember Isabel Farrow,

01:07:45.365 --> 01:07:47.498
the crazy rich socialite
whose crypto wallet I thought

01:07:47.585 --> 01:07:48.586
was stored in the bank
in Seattle?

01:07:48.673 --> 01:07:50.718
- Right.
- This is it!

01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:52.677
This is the 600 million
that I was talkin' about!

01:07:52.764 --> 01:07:53.765
This is it! We got it!

01:07:53.852 --> 01:07:55.332
We finally got it!

01:07:55.419 --> 01:07:57.812
You know what I think?

01:07:57.899 --> 01:08:01.599
I think-- I think Bella
is Isabel Farrow.

01:08:01.686 --> 01:08:04.080
She left Salazar for Zade.

01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:06.473
- Right?
- That tracks.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.302
But it-- it doesn't--
it doesn't totally make sense.

01:08:09.389 --> 01:08:13.089
- What do you mean?
- Think about it.

01:08:13.176 --> 01:08:15.265
Salazar's one of
the richest people in the world.

01:08:15.352 --> 01:08:17.876
He doesn't need
$600 million.

01:08:17.963 --> 01:08:20.444
Okay?
So he wants something else.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.708
He said,
"Look for a hard drive."

01:08:24.622 --> 01:08:26.450
Oh, fuck.

01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:29.453
It's-- it's the dirt box.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.063
- Again?
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:33.544
Bella goes to her safe box.
Right?

01:08:33.631 --> 01:08:35.459
She gets her crypto wallet,

01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:37.591
and she makes a clone
of the dirt box

01:08:37.678 --> 01:08:39.593
and brings it down to Zade.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.118
Okay. Now, Zade is competitive
with his brother.

01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:44.207
So he thinks if he uses
the dirt box in the right way,

01:08:44.294 --> 01:08:45.512
he could take over.

01:08:45.599 --> 01:08:47.906
He could be the power.
He could take the throne.

01:08:47.993 --> 01:08:50.213
That explains why Salazar
has been so coy

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.823
about what we're after.

01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:53.477
- He's paranoid.
- Yeah.

01:08:53.564 --> 01:08:55.740
He's totally paranoid that we're
gonna upload it again for us.

01:08:57.176 --> 01:08:59.265
But I was right about
the crypto wallet, right?

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:00.440
- Yes, Shawn.
- Uh?

01:09:00.527 --> 01:09:02.050
We-- we established that
a couple of times.

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:03.878
But if it's not
in one of Zade's safes,

01:09:03.965 --> 01:09:05.097
- where could it be?
- Okay.

01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:06.316
Well, it's not in
the jewelry box.

01:09:06.403 --> 01:09:09.188
And it's not in
the thumb drive.

01:09:10.929 --> 01:09:12.931
So, we have to keep--
we have to keep looking.

01:09:13.018 --> 01:09:14.585
What am I looking for?

01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:17.675
I think that we look
for anything he's purchased

01:09:17.762 --> 01:09:19.372
in the last few months.

01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:22.288
Especially if it's--
if-- if it's custom-made.

01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:23.289
Okay.

01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:31.689
Uh-uh.

01:09:31.776 --> 01:09:33.473
Oh, nice and easy.

01:09:36.476 --> 01:09:37.347
Sweet dreams.

01:09:39.653 --> 01:09:40.785
This is Don.

01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:43.614
Tell me Shawn found the drive.

01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:48.227
It's not the dirt box, Abel.

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:51.274
You have nothing
to worry about.

01:09:51.361 --> 01:09:52.927
All I want is Amy back.

01:09:54.102 --> 01:09:55.930
Then you better fucking find it.

01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:13.252
Oh, hello there.

01:10:15.733 --> 01:10:16.777
Fuck.

01:10:18.736 --> 01:10:20.216
Not lovin' it, huh?

01:10:21.304 --> 01:10:23.915
I knew you were gonna try this.

01:10:24.002 --> 01:10:25.873
I'm just surprised
it took you this long.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.874
What were you gonna do?

01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:28.615
Try to kill me?

01:10:28.702 --> 01:10:29.660
Maybe.

01:10:30.574 --> 01:10:32.315
I knew you were a killer.

01:10:32.402 --> 01:10:34.142
I never said I wasn't.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.493
And you never told me
what it feels like

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.016
to take someone's life.

01:10:38.103 --> 01:10:39.800
- Hmm.
- Tell me.

01:10:42.629 --> 01:10:44.065
Okay. Well...

01:10:45.893 --> 01:10:47.199
...that all depends.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.854
On what?

01:10:50.985 --> 01:10:52.291
Well...

01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:57.383
Well, if the person
really, really deserves it,

01:10:57.470 --> 01:11:00.952
like their mere existence
causes pain and suffering,...

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:03.824
...it kind of feels like sex.

01:11:03.911 --> 01:11:05.609
Ooh.

01:11:05.696 --> 01:11:08.002
His weapon is loaded.

01:11:08.089 --> 01:11:09.830
Hollow points.

01:11:13.399 --> 01:11:14.661
Champagne?

01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:16.837
Can't help a girl from trying.

01:11:18.143 --> 01:11:19.536
Salud.

01:11:19.623 --> 01:11:21.233
I need you to clean this up.

01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:25.977
Uh,
it ain't coronavirus, guys.

01:11:26.064 --> 01:11:27.848
Don't worry about it, all right?

01:11:27.935 --> 01:11:29.372
Don't worry.

01:11:29.459 --> 01:11:31.243
You guys all nervous.
You know what I mean?

01:11:33.376 --> 01:11:35.073
This guy right here,
that's your boss?

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.161
Yeah?

01:11:37.858 --> 01:11:39.556
Got the whole squad here, huh?

01:11:39.643 --> 01:11:40.731
What up?

01:11:42.341 --> 01:11:43.995
Who are you?

01:11:44.082 --> 01:11:45.562
I'm Phil.

01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:47.128
Who the fuck are you?

01:11:47.955 --> 01:11:50.218
You trying to steal from me,
Phil?

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:51.437
Steal from you?

01:11:51.524 --> 01:11:52.612
My mom taught me
better than that.

01:11:52.699 --> 01:11:53.744
Come on, man.

01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:54.571
Just playing with
some fireworks.

01:11:54.658 --> 01:11:56.486
You know what I'm saying?

01:11:56.573 --> 01:11:58.139
Get 'em in Mexico, dog.

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:01.969
At the same time,
my slots get hacked.

01:12:03.014 --> 01:12:04.711
You think I'm stupid?

01:12:04.798 --> 01:12:06.017
I don't think you're stupid.

01:12:06.104 --> 01:12:08.628
I mean, I think you look stupid,
but I don't know.

01:12:08.715 --> 01:12:09.803
Are you stupid?

01:12:15.287 --> 01:12:16.680
I wrap my own material,
by the way.

01:12:19.422 --> 01:12:20.597
Have a seat, man.

01:12:20.684 --> 01:12:22.163
Why not?

01:12:30.737 --> 01:12:32.652
900 degrees Celsius.

01:12:34.524 --> 01:12:37.440
That's how hot
a burning cigar can get.

01:12:38.528 --> 01:12:40.051
I bet you didn't know that.

01:12:40.138 --> 01:12:40.965
Nah.

01:12:41.052 --> 01:12:43.010
I was absent that day.

01:12:43.097 --> 01:12:45.056
It's kind of wild, huh?

01:12:45.143 --> 01:12:46.405
It's interesting.

01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:50.540
Who you working with?

01:12:54.282 --> 01:12:56.459
Hey, man, let me make something
clear to you, all right?

01:12:56.546 --> 01:12:58.112
I had a few of your drinks.

01:12:58.199 --> 01:13:00.288
They were spiked.
They were free.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:01.464
Everything tastes better
when it's free.

01:13:01.551 --> 01:13:02.682
You know what I mean?

01:13:03.596 --> 01:13:06.120
You got the wrong idea
about me, homeboy.

01:13:06.207 --> 01:13:07.557
Get that through your head.

01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:12.344
Do you have any idea

01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:16.827
what 900 degrees does
to the human eyeball?

01:13:18.785 --> 01:13:21.309
Okay, Shawn, you come with me.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:22.659
Link, keep goin'.

01:13:23.616 --> 01:13:24.748
- The feds are here.
- What?

01:13:24.835 --> 01:13:26.358
I said the feds are here!

01:13:27.968 --> 01:13:29.579
Richter?

01:13:29.666 --> 01:13:31.145
Yeah, in the lobby.

01:13:32.973 --> 01:13:34.366
What do we do now?

01:13:36.847 --> 01:13:38.805
Just keep playing jazz. Come on.

01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:40.154
Shawn, let's go.

01:13:43.027 --> 01:13:44.898
Okay, we should split.

01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:46.596
I'm-- I'm busy.

01:13:46.683 --> 01:13:48.424
We can get out of here,
just the two of us.

01:13:49.816 --> 01:13:51.601
You know how we roll, right?

01:13:51.688 --> 01:13:53.994
If this ship's going down,
I'm going down with it.

01:13:54.081 --> 01:13:54.995
So let me work.

01:13:55.082 --> 01:13:56.997
Yeah, okay. Sorry.

01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:01.915
Whoever you're protecting...

01:14:02.002 --> 01:14:03.264
Uh-huh.

01:14:03.351 --> 01:14:05.484
I promise, they're not worth
that kind of pain.

01:14:07.747 --> 01:14:09.227
All right.

01:14:09.314 --> 01:14:10.620
That's something to think about.

01:14:11.577 --> 01:14:14.406
To be honest,

01:14:14.493 --> 01:14:16.364
I was planning on
doin' this anyway.

01:14:24.677 --> 01:14:25.635
This is Zade.

01:14:25.722 --> 01:14:26.592
Mr. Zade, uh, we--

01:14:26.679 --> 01:14:28.246
Yes, Tanya, what is it?

01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:29.465
We have a little problem
with the elevator.

01:14:29.552 --> 01:14:30.944
The fucking elevator?

01:14:31.031 --> 01:14:32.293
Yes, sir.

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.425
Uh, we got him out

01:14:33.512 --> 01:14:35.427
and he's finally
in the penthouse now,

01:14:35.514 --> 01:14:38.648
but Mr. Antonelli is very upset.

01:14:38.735 --> 01:14:41.389
Um, he wants to see
you immediately.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:43.174
Tell him I'll be right up.

01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:48.484
To be continued, Phil.

01:14:51.748 --> 01:14:52.923
Shit.

01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:54.446
There's Richter
and his whole fucking team.

01:14:54.533 --> 01:14:55.534
You go around this way.

01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:56.753
You two with me.

01:14:58.058 --> 01:14:59.407
You go secure our escape route.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.192
Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:15:07.807 --> 01:15:10.244
- I'll cover West Side.
- I'll take this one.

01:15:15.249 --> 01:15:16.381
Babe?

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.345
Since when do you have
a second burner?

01:15:32.092 --> 01:15:33.703
Caras, can you hear me?

01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:36.880
Mason knows we're
after the dirt box.

01:15:36.967 --> 01:15:38.664
Make sure he finds it.

01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:40.840
But do not let your
little girlfriend upload it.

01:15:49.762 --> 01:15:51.242
Hey, sweetie.

01:15:52.765 --> 01:15:54.027
It was you.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.073
What?

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.163
You wiped my servers the night
of our fucking wedding.

01:16:02.296 --> 01:16:04.647
It's not what it looks like,
Link.

01:16:04.734 --> 01:16:06.779
Do not fucking touch me.

01:16:06.866 --> 01:16:10.087
You got me drunk,
so I passed out.

01:16:10.174 --> 01:16:12.611
You scanned my face
and my thumb.

01:16:14.787 --> 01:16:16.484
Is that about right?

01:16:20.445 --> 01:16:21.794
Yeah, it's true.

01:16:23.056 --> 01:16:25.406
I fuckin' hated Mason for
making me look like a fool

01:16:25.493 --> 01:16:26.886
in my own bank.

01:16:26.973 --> 01:16:28.496
I wanted revenge.

01:16:29.062 --> 01:16:30.586
Uh.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.849
Salazar was threatening
to kill my family, sweetie.

01:16:32.936 --> 01:16:34.807
I don't wanna hear this.

01:16:34.894 --> 01:16:36.026
I got to know you guys.

01:16:36.113 --> 01:16:37.549
Everything changed.

01:16:37.636 --> 01:16:38.855
I don't wanna hear this.

01:16:38.942 --> 01:16:39.682
You gotta believe me.

01:16:39.769 --> 01:16:40.770
Do not touch me!

01:16:41.988 --> 01:16:42.728
I don't wanna hear this.

01:16:42.815 --> 01:16:43.816
I love you, Link.

01:16:43.903 --> 01:16:44.948
I love you more
than anything else.

01:16:45.035 --> 01:16:47.341
Do not fuckin' say this to me!

01:16:50.867 --> 01:16:52.216
Get out.

01:16:52.303 --> 01:16:53.913
- Get the fuck out.
- Please.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.394
Get the fuck out now.

01:16:56.481 --> 01:16:58.178
Get out!

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.630
Are you okay?

01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:20.157
- You heard that?
- I did.

01:17:20.244 --> 01:17:21.593
I'm so sorry.

01:17:23.334 --> 01:17:26.250
Um, I'm over it.

01:17:26.337 --> 01:17:28.731
Um, back to work.

01:17:28.818 --> 01:17:30.080
Clearly you're not.

01:17:30.167 --> 01:17:31.734
And neither am I.

01:17:32.996 --> 01:17:35.607
I'm diving back
into the purchase orders.

01:17:35.694 --> 01:17:36.782
There's a lot of them.

01:17:38.741 --> 01:17:42.570
I was thinking, you know,
casinos have safe deposit boxes.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:45.704
Yeah, um, don't second guess
your instincts.

01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:49.403
Zade is way too impressed
with himself to be that basic.

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:50.622
Don!

01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:52.189
There you are.

01:17:52.276 --> 01:17:54.408
So sorry for the disruption,
but we are ready to resume,

01:17:54.495 --> 01:17:56.802
and Chaz is anxiously
awaiting your arrival.

01:17:56.889 --> 01:17:58.499
Okay, well, give me 20 minutes.

01:17:58.586 --> 01:18:00.850
I have some business to do
with Chico, and I'll be back.

01:18:00.937 --> 01:18:03.330
I'm afraid I must insist
you come with me now.

01:18:06.769 --> 01:18:10.598
Well, normally I would be
insulted by that kind of thing,

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:13.123
but you've got me intrigued.

01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:15.038
So because you're the lady
of the house,

01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:16.866
I, uh, I'm all yours.

01:18:16.953 --> 01:18:18.345
Shall we?

01:18:26.745 --> 01:18:28.094
Chaz looks well.

01:18:28.181 --> 01:18:30.009
You can hardly detect his limp
anymore.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:33.665
Chaz has never had a limp.

01:18:33.752 --> 01:18:35.449
I think you know that, Bella.

01:18:35.536 --> 01:18:37.147
Who are you?

01:18:37.234 --> 01:18:40.367
- I'm Donovan Cage.
- I don't think so.

01:18:40.454 --> 01:18:42.152
Far too many strange things
have been happening tonight,

01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:44.241
and you seem to be at
the center of all of them.

01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:47.200
I'm intrigued, however.

01:18:47.287 --> 01:18:48.506
You obviously have deep pockets,

01:18:48.593 --> 01:18:50.769
and I consider myself
a businesswoman.

01:18:50.856 --> 01:18:52.510
I could possibly be persuaded
to help you

01:18:52.597 --> 01:18:53.685
with whatever it is
you're looking for

01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:55.121
if the price is right.

01:18:57.863 --> 01:19:00.823
Are you speaking
on behalf of Zade?

01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:03.347
I speak on behalf
of only myself.

01:19:03.434 --> 01:19:05.653
Their loyalty lies with me.

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:07.481
What Zade doesn't know
won't hurt him.

01:19:07.568 --> 01:19:08.352
Hmm.

01:19:08.439 --> 01:19:10.049
You may speak freely.

01:19:11.094 --> 01:19:12.922
Jackpot, Mason.

01:19:13.009 --> 01:19:15.054
Zade paid a fortune
for what's gonna be

01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:16.839
one of themost expensive
hidden compartments

01:19:16.926 --> 01:19:18.623
in the world.

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:19.667
Oh, yeah?

01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:22.018
This is your last chance.

01:19:22.105 --> 01:19:24.281
It's inside of a big Ruby.

01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:29.503
No, I can speak freely.

01:19:31.636 --> 01:19:34.726
I don't have a clue of
what you're talking about.

01:19:34.813 --> 01:19:36.380
And if you don't mind,

01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:38.991
I'd like you to stop
wasting my fucking time

01:19:39.078 --> 01:19:42.255
and take me to my dear friend
Chaz Antonelli.

01:19:44.127 --> 01:19:46.085
I'm disappointed, Mr. Cage.

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.393
You said we were
gonna be friends.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:51.047
We're not gonna be friends.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.354
As you wish.

01:19:58.445 --> 01:19:59.533
Chaz!

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:00.708
Chaz!

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:02.232
Chaz, it's me. It's Don.

01:20:02.319 --> 01:20:03.276
How are you?

01:20:03.363 --> 01:20:04.495
Uh, you look great.

01:20:04.582 --> 01:20:05.931
You look like you
gained some weight.

01:20:06.018 --> 01:20:06.976
Who the fuck are you?

01:20:07.063 --> 01:20:08.978
Link, plan B.

01:20:09.065 --> 01:20:10.980
Who the fuck is this guy?

01:20:11.981 --> 01:20:15.071
That man,
he was not Donovan Cage, no.

01:20:15.158 --> 01:20:16.594
He took my necklace.

01:20:16.681 --> 01:20:18.030
He took my necklace.

01:20:18.117 --> 01:20:19.075
Go!

01:20:19.162 --> 01:20:20.206
Go find him!

01:20:33.219 --> 01:20:35.134
Let's go, Link. Checkout time!

01:20:35.221 --> 01:20:37.136
Okay. On my way.

01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:27.708
Mason, let's go!

01:21:30.059 --> 01:21:31.451
You're never getting out
of here alive!

01:21:31.538 --> 01:21:32.888
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

01:21:39.155 --> 01:21:40.634
Man all the exits.

01:21:40.721 --> 01:21:43.289
I want the entire perimeter
surrounded by local police!

01:22:01.177 --> 01:22:02.004
Oh, hell yeah, man!

01:22:02.091 --> 01:22:03.092
What took you so long, man?

01:22:03.179 --> 01:22:04.528
Shit.

01:22:04.615 --> 01:22:06.356
- Better late than never, my boy.
- Ha-ha! Come on, now.

01:22:07.661 --> 01:22:08.532
Yeah.

01:22:08.619 --> 01:22:09.837
- What's up, man?
- Come on, now.

01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:27.768
Security.

01:22:32.599 --> 01:22:33.470
Go.

01:22:33.557 --> 01:22:35.167
Find him and bring him to me.

01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:38.083
Zade, they're headed
to the theater.

01:23:06.546 --> 01:23:07.939
Hands up, guys.

01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:10.550
What's happening, Agent Richter?

01:23:17.688 --> 01:23:18.515
Oh, good. You made it.

01:23:18.602 --> 01:23:19.777
Yeah.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.435
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah. Feds got 'em.

01:23:25.522 --> 01:23:26.305
That's bad.

01:23:26.392 --> 01:23:27.872
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

01:23:27.959 --> 01:23:29.352
- This will take us to the
shrimp factory.
- Okay, let's go.

01:23:29.439 --> 01:23:30.309
- Okay.
- You lead.

01:23:30.396 --> 01:23:31.963
Go. Go. Go.

01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:34.270
You guys are full of surprises.

01:23:37.534 --> 01:23:39.057
Get out.

01:23:39.144 --> 01:23:40.798
Get out where I can see you.

01:23:45.194 --> 01:23:47.805
You surprised me, too,
with that ace up your sleeve.

01:23:48.762 --> 01:23:51.635
I know you like to win,
but, uh,

01:23:51.722 --> 01:23:53.463
it must have been
hard for you, huh?

01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:56.988
Your older brother Abel
always havin' to be the winner.

01:23:57.858 --> 01:23:59.382
My fuckin' brother.

01:24:00.557 --> 01:24:02.037
Of course.

01:24:03.429 --> 01:24:04.691
He sent you.

01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:08.347
Give me the necklace.

01:24:08.434 --> 01:24:09.740
I can't do that.

01:24:10.436 --> 01:24:11.829
Your brother will kill
the woman I love,

01:24:11.916 --> 01:24:13.396
and I can't do that.

01:24:15.876 --> 01:24:17.574
And?

01:24:17.661 --> 01:24:19.402
And that's not gonna happen.

01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:21.491
That's your plan?

01:24:22.187 --> 01:24:23.493
That's my plan.

01:24:24.711 --> 01:24:26.322
You know how much
the information hidden

01:24:26.409 --> 01:24:27.714
on that necklace is worth?

01:24:27.801 --> 01:24:28.889
I do.

01:24:30.108 --> 01:24:31.283
I don't believe you're gonna
trade it

01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:32.893
for the life of some woman.

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:35.418
I am.

01:24:36.288 --> 01:24:37.637
You're not a whale.

01:24:38.856 --> 01:24:41.554
You're nothing
but a fucking minnow!

01:24:48.953 --> 01:24:50.085
George!

01:24:58.397 --> 01:24:59.833
Drop it.

01:25:04.577 --> 01:25:05.361
I'm sorry.

01:25:05.448 --> 01:25:06.623
Okay, just one second.

01:25:08.581 --> 01:25:10.105
You're not gonna
get the necklace, Bella.

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.890
I want nothing to do
with that necklace.

01:25:14.848 --> 01:25:18.765
Zade stole something from me,
and I'm gonna get it back.

01:25:21.246 --> 01:25:22.813
You guys should get out of here.

01:25:25.424 --> 01:25:26.251
Let's go. Come on.

01:25:26.338 --> 01:25:27.078
What the fuck was that?

01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:28.384
Come on! Get him up!

01:25:29.298 --> 01:25:30.473
Come on.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.604
Come on.

01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:33.867
Get him in. Help--
help him in. Link first.

01:25:33.954 --> 01:25:35.478
Let-- let me go,
let me go!

01:25:39.351 --> 01:25:40.657
Go on. Go on.

01:26:00.242 --> 01:26:01.460
What the fuck!

01:26:04.724 --> 01:26:05.769
Come on, let's go.

01:26:14.256 --> 01:26:15.735
Let's go, guys.

01:26:20.871 --> 01:26:22.220
Got a tail.

01:26:22.873 --> 01:26:24.440
They're going through
the shrimp processing plant.

01:26:35.886 --> 01:26:37.148
Guys, this way.

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:15.055
Let's go. Let's go.

01:27:15.142 --> 01:27:16.927
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:27:27.764 --> 01:27:28.852
Come on, move it!

01:27:42.518 --> 01:27:43.258
Come on.

01:27:43.345 --> 01:27:44.259
Come on.

01:28:00.405 --> 01:28:01.711
Go! Go!

01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:14.680
Go! Go!

01:28:14.767 --> 01:28:16.900
Go! Go! Go!

01:29:01.727 --> 01:29:02.467
Come, come.

01:29:02.554 --> 01:29:03.816
This way. This way.

01:29:05.165 --> 01:29:06.036
Come on, let's go!

01:29:06.123 --> 01:29:06.950
Come, come.

01:29:07.037 --> 01:29:08.821
This way. This way. This way.

01:29:15.132 --> 01:29:16.612
Go! Go!

01:29:35.065 --> 01:29:36.632
Let's go! Let's go!

01:29:42.899 --> 01:29:44.814
How exciting!

01:29:46.206 --> 01:29:48.513
Come on, Mason.
Put the gun down.

01:29:54.911 --> 01:29:57.217
I was led to believe
you were no murderer.

01:29:59.176 --> 01:30:00.873
Just protecting my family.

01:30:03.093 --> 01:30:04.268
You okay, Amy?

01:30:04.355 --> 01:30:05.225
I'm okay, baby.

01:30:05.312 --> 01:30:06.313
It's good to see you.

01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:11.884
Relax.

01:30:12.842 --> 01:30:14.452
It's your boss's dirt box.

01:30:21.111 --> 01:30:23.200
Ah, how cute.

01:30:23.287 --> 01:30:25.724
Zade always did love
his little shiny toys.

01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:29.815
How do I know you didn't upload
these on the way over, Link?

01:30:29.902 --> 01:30:31.904
I'm so done with your dirt,
Salazar.

01:30:33.253 --> 01:30:34.733
Okay.
We came through for you.

01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:36.387
Let us have Amy.

01:30:36.474 --> 01:30:37.606
Come on.

01:30:38.607 --> 01:30:41.044
After all you put me through
in Seattle,

01:30:41.131 --> 01:30:43.307
you really think I can forgive
and forget?

01:30:44.003 --> 01:30:46.571
Abel,
this is a fucking deal, man.

01:30:46.658 --> 01:30:47.833
This is a deal.

01:30:51.663 --> 01:30:53.360
Decker or the dirt box?

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:54.753
That's right.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:58.453
I intend to honor it
with one minor caveat.

01:30:58.540 --> 01:30:59.671
What?

01:30:59.758 --> 01:31:01.630
I don't know if she'd admit it,

01:31:01.717 --> 01:31:03.936
but I was a gracious host
to Amelia.

01:31:04.023 --> 01:31:05.416
We shared a nice meal

01:31:05.503 --> 01:31:08.114
and had an interesting
conversation.

01:31:08.201 --> 01:31:10.290
She implied I was a murderer.

01:31:10.377 --> 01:31:13.772
But I had to correct her.

01:31:13.859 --> 01:31:18.037
I have personally never
killed a single human being.

01:31:18.124 --> 01:31:21.563
Later, Amy told me that
the feeling of doing so,

01:31:21.650 --> 01:31:25.871
of murdering someone,
was rather erotic.

01:31:26.698 --> 01:31:28.439
Well, not my exact words.

01:31:28.526 --> 01:31:32.312
Assuming the person being killed
was deserving of it.

01:31:32.399 --> 01:31:36.665
But I have a grim view
of humanity.

01:31:36.752 --> 01:31:38.754
I'm not a Bible man.

01:31:38.841 --> 01:31:41.931
But I do see the logic
of original sin.

01:31:42.018 --> 01:31:44.499
No one is innocent.

01:31:46.718 --> 01:31:49.068
So,
given my world view,

01:31:49.155 --> 01:31:52.463
and if Decker's assessment
is accurate,

01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:55.422
then I have really
been missing out.

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:57.773
Makes me regret
not killing my wife myself.

01:31:59.252 --> 01:32:00.863
I don't know
who's more fucked up.

01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:03.039
You or your brother Zade.

01:32:03.126 --> 01:32:05.345
You came through
with the dirt box,

01:32:05.432 --> 01:32:07.043
so you can take Decker.

01:32:07.130 --> 01:32:08.218
Thank you.

01:32:08.305 --> 01:32:12.614
But if you do that,
I will kill Shawn.

01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:16.531
You're so fucking sick.

01:32:16.618 --> 01:32:18.271
That's not the deal.

01:32:18.358 --> 01:32:19.272
You don't want your brother
to die?

01:32:19.359 --> 01:32:20.578
Fine!

01:32:20.665 --> 01:32:22.537
Then I'll kill Decker,
the love of your life.

01:32:22.624 --> 01:32:23.929
You choose, Mason.

01:32:24.016 --> 01:32:26.497
Okay, you wanna get a kick
out of killing someone.

01:32:26.584 --> 01:32:28.412
Is that right?

01:32:28.499 --> 01:32:29.413
Choose me.

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:30.545
- Mason.
- Kill me, Abel.

01:32:30.632 --> 01:32:31.937
- Mason.
- Yes.

01:32:32.024 --> 01:32:33.112
- No, no. You kill me.
- Shawn.

01:32:33.199 --> 01:32:34.244
Kill me!

01:32:34.331 --> 01:32:35.550
Shawn, shut up. Shut up.

01:32:36.725 --> 01:32:38.204
Do it.

01:32:38.291 --> 01:32:39.205
Do it.

01:32:39.292 --> 01:32:40.946
Come on, motherfucker. Do it.

01:32:41.033 --> 01:32:42.426
Come on, man.

01:32:42.513 --> 01:32:43.732
Do it.

01:32:43.819 --> 01:32:45.211
- Oh, yeah?
- I wanna see it, Abel.

01:32:45.298 --> 01:32:46.996
Come on, motherfucker.
Do it.

01:32:47.083 --> 01:32:48.258
Do it.

01:32:49.651 --> 01:32:51.174
Do it.

01:32:52.175 --> 01:32:53.219
Freeze! FBI!

01:32:53.306 --> 01:32:55.047
You're completely surrounded!

01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:56.658
Put the gun down!

01:32:56.745 --> 01:32:57.615
Down!

01:32:57.702 --> 01:32:58.398
Get on your knees!

01:32:58.485 --> 01:32:59.574
Right now!

01:32:59.661 --> 01:33:01.358
Get down!

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:03.447
Come on, Salazar.

01:33:03.534 --> 01:33:05.057
Tell your men
to lower their weapons.

01:33:06.145 --> 01:33:07.364
You wanna end it all right here.

01:33:07.451 --> 01:33:08.844
Come on.

01:33:08.931 --> 01:33:09.932
Why don't you give your
team of lawyers a chance

01:33:10.019 --> 01:33:11.324
to get you out of this?

01:33:11.411 --> 01:33:13.326
You and all your money
against Uncle Sam.

01:33:13.413 --> 01:33:14.414
What do you say?

01:33:15.285 --> 01:33:17.374
I have diplomatic immunity.

01:33:17.461 --> 01:33:19.158
My legal team will bury you.

01:33:21.247 --> 01:33:22.379
Take their weapons.

01:33:22.466 --> 01:33:23.685
Cuff 'em.

01:33:23.772 --> 01:33:25.730
Jesus Christ,
it took you long enough.

01:33:25.817 --> 01:33:27.123
Yeah, you are right.

01:33:32.041 --> 01:33:33.390
Nice to see you, Amy.

01:33:33.477 --> 01:33:35.218
Vern. Mace. What's goin' on?

01:33:35.305 --> 01:33:36.828
Did you set this up?

01:33:38.438 --> 01:33:40.571
You go secure our escape route.
Go ahead.

01:33:40.658 --> 01:33:41.877
Go ahead.

01:33:45.663 --> 01:33:47.143
And you guys over there.

01:33:55.455 --> 01:33:56.543
Hello?

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:58.937
Richter. This is Mason.

01:34:00.896 --> 01:34:02.985
What do you say we make a deal?

01:34:04.508 --> 01:34:06.292
I'm listening.

01:34:07.554 --> 01:34:08.904
Did you set this up?

01:34:10.296 --> 01:34:12.255
You're a fuckin' idiot, Mason!

01:34:13.386 --> 01:34:14.910
You just fucked us all!

01:34:26.530 --> 01:34:27.618
Open it.

01:34:31.753 --> 01:34:33.319
All right.
Everybody out.

01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:40.370
What's up?

01:34:43.416 --> 01:34:45.201
baby. Yeah!

01:34:45.288 --> 01:34:46.115
How you doing, my man?

01:34:49.379 --> 01:34:50.467
Ah.

01:34:50.554 --> 01:34:51.250
It's awesome to see you guys.

01:34:53.165 --> 01:34:54.776
All right.
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:34:54.863 --> 01:34:56.603
What's goin' on here?

01:34:56.691 --> 01:34:58.997
Get a room! Get a room!
Get a room!

01:34:59.302 --> 01:35:00.433
Oh, my God.

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:03.523
Mason. What did you do?

01:35:04.524 --> 01:35:06.091
Well, he cut a deal.

01:35:06.178 --> 01:35:07.440
- I can tell 'em?
- Go ahead.

01:35:07.527 --> 01:35:09.355
- It's official?
- Official.

01:35:10.313 --> 01:35:11.444
Go ahead.

01:35:12.576 --> 01:35:13.664
I'm sorry, baby.

01:35:13.751 --> 01:35:15.579
I'm sorry, everybody.

01:35:15.666 --> 01:35:17.015
I wanted to tell you earlier,
but I couldn't

01:35:17.102 --> 01:35:18.756
until it was official.

01:35:18.843 --> 01:35:20.149
You're good.

01:35:20.236 --> 01:35:23.413
So you know that we were,
you know, proudly

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:25.458
on the most wanted FBI list,

01:35:25.545 --> 01:35:27.504
but nothing compared to Salazar.

01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:28.505
That's right.

01:35:28.592 --> 01:35:29.767
And as promised,
you delivered him

01:35:29.854 --> 01:35:31.856
and his dirt box
into federal custody.

01:35:31.943 --> 01:35:33.162
And got each of you immunity.

01:35:34.424 --> 01:35:35.207
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:35.294 --> 01:35:36.382
But don't fuck it up.

01:35:36.469 --> 01:35:37.514
I don't wanna come
after you again, guys.

01:35:37.601 --> 01:35:39.037
- Oh, my God.
- All right.

01:35:39.124 --> 01:35:41.431
Mason, right behind,
you got your jet fully fueled

01:35:41.518 --> 01:35:42.998
and ready to go as promised.

01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:46.697
- Yeah.
- What? What?

01:35:46.784 --> 01:35:47.916
- That-- that's our jet?
- All right, let's go.

01:35:48.003 --> 01:35:49.439
That-- that's really our jet?

01:35:54.879 --> 01:35:56.751
You're so clever.
You're the most--

01:35:56.838 --> 01:35:57.795
Hey. Hey!

01:35:57.882 --> 01:35:58.709

What is that?

01:36:01.581 --> 01:36:03.583
- Mason, you wanna tell 'em?
- No, you, man. Go ahead.

01:36:04.802 --> 01:36:06.195
You remember the hard drive

01:36:06.282 --> 01:36:08.023
that we were trying to get
in Seattle?

01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:34.701
No.

01:36:37.748 --> 01:36:38.705
